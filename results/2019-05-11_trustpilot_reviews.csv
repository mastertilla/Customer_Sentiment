0,5cd6881ea843690a7cd16dc8,"I baught a printer from PC World and when I had problems with it went to the Bradford store to take it back. When I said I had purchased it from them on EBAY (and they had it on their system) they said they would not deal with it. So I phoned PC World and they said I had to contact them via EBAY? I rang the number they gave me, NO ASWER so I tried to contact them via ebay nearly 2 months ago and to date have still not heard from them. What load of rubish, if they were my staff when I managed shops I would have shown them the doore. But it is not the first time I have had problems with their staff in their shop, they were very abrupt and with atitued. It is not the first time I have purchased on line and taken it back, they replaced it on that occasion. The problem with large companies is that they do not care and forget that it is we, the public that keep them going. I have walked out on many occasions because I could find staff to help me, and if you do find one they are like little Hitlers. iT IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH and they are not the cheapest on the market what ever they say. I have had to purchase a new printer from else where as I needed it for work, do PC WORLD CARE, NO. I am never dealing with them again, I know other firms that are cheeper and look after their customers far better.",2019-05-11

Needless to say we cancelled the Oder at the shop and we will never purchase anything from them again. Looking on line two other companies could have delivered the next day but we thought it would be better to purchase locally how wrong we were.",2019-05-11
2,5cd5f722a843690bd00b203a,"I bought a new Beko washing machine from Currys, and on delivery found that a container for liquid soap, mentioned in the manual was not supplied. The store phoned Beko for me, and they said the part would be delivered as soon as possible. When the part had not arrived after a week, I received an email from Beko saying I would have to pay for it. I went back to the store and they only phoned Beko after I insisted. Beko gave Currys the same reply, despite Beko's employee making a promise to Currys over the phone which was not kept. Beko sent me supposed evidence, very weak, 'proving' that this part is an extra. It is absolutely ridiculous that they both made such a stand about a part worth pennies, but essential for full use of the machine.. Whatever happened to customer satisfaction. I left the store after telling the manager that companies only stayed in business by giving good customer service. No wonder people are shopping on the internet with service like this.",2019-05-10

When I have challenged this decision I’ve been told by the social media team that I would have to speak to the chief exec of the company. Horrific experience encountered overall with Curry’s.

5,5cd566dba843690af0d8fae2,"Buckle up folks because I’m about to tell you all about my nightmare experience with this company...Ordered a fridge and washing machine from them 27th April at the White City store. The systems were down but we were assured that our delivery date of a week later would be met for both items and that we’d get a telephone call confirming this the next day. No surprise there was no phone call. It reached Tuesday and we got in touch to check all was ok for our agreed date. No surprise again that there was a problem getting the fridge for then. After speaking with three different people we were told the delivery date would be the 8th, then the 9th and then 29th May. Absolute debacle so we cancelled the fridge order and continued with the washing machine. Paid for installation and they met agreed delivery date of 4th May. Guy came and installed it blocking access to kitchen cupboards, I asked him to move it to the other space we have for it and the guy says ‘no, it’s done now’ switched on a test wash and left. So we called back to ask someone to move it and install it. Guy comes out two days later does it also leaves after turning on a test wash. 15 minutes later we call the guy back to ask him to check it as the machine isn’t draining- no response. Called Curry’s customer service line, they sent another team today 10th May and they’ve identified a problem with the machine. We’ve been unable to do laundry for two weeks. We’ve been passed from pillar to post through curry’s various customer service teams and they keep passing us off to bosch. No sense of urgency or customer care from this company. Absolutely rubbish service and a complete nightmare when you’re trying to move house. I can honestly say pop into the store to look at the product and get it online from another business because this experience has been an utter farce.UPDATE: thanks for responding to my review and providing a contact email address.",2019-05-10
6,5cd53c5ea843690a7cd0ef2e,"Retailers complain that customers are ""abandoning"" stores and shopping with online competitors, but maybe if their stock control was better they may find they get more direct custom. The last few times I have gone to Currys to buy items (white Echo Spot/Dyson dehumidifier/Epson printer) they have been out of stock. I was happy to get the printer delivered but inexplicably it was not ""available for home delivery"" and the nearest stock was at a store far away from both my nearest branches. So, as much as I want to support physical stores, they need to up their game first.",2019-05-10

8,5cd4575fa843690a7cd0a498,"Be careful about what you buy. Curry is aware of possible software issues but will not let you know of their existence when you buy. And how software problems can generate random errors, they keep silent until you need service for the purchased item. And as the warranty does not cover the sotware side, I wish you success in shopping from the curry.",2019-05-09

Secondly, the item arrived with the packaging already opened with a used product inside.Thirdly, received the most vile and disgusting attitude from the duty manager Andy. Curry's is without doubt already known to be Britain's worst electrical retailer. Thank you Andy for making my experience with Curry's one of the worst in history. Hopefully enough people will complain about your disgusting attitude and total disregard for customers and Curry's will fire you!",2019-05-09
10,5cd4295ea843690a7cd085b1,"I bought a fridge on Friday with a commitment to deliver on the following Wednesday. All good exactly the day we wanted. I got a text to say delivery would be between 16.10 and 20.10. OK not ideal but we can cope, someone was in the whole time.They didnt show up. NO message, no phone. Meanwhile the freezer food goes to waste. The switch board closes at 20.00 so we cant ring them. But the online tracker says delivery on Friday. Seemed to forget there was a day inbetween!Ring today to find out what happened. Drivers had reached there hours limit for the day. I understand this from a H&S point of view. But this was obvious from the start. So my assessment, dont believe a word that is said. Dont expect any communication that is helpful, dont expect proactive behaviour and generally look to buy from a store that delivers every time when they say they will.",2019-05-09
11,5cd401c4a8436908c4157655,"AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!Went into the Watford branch to order an American fridge freezer a whole month ago. Arranged delivery waited in all day for no one to turn up! When i called to find out where they were i was told they were in an accident and they would rearange delivery for the next day. I had to arrange for someone to be home as i had taken the privious day off work for the delivery. When i arrived home that day i found they had delivered the wrong one. Its was a much smaller, cheaper one. When i called them they said they couldnt collect for almost a week!!!!When they eventually came to pick it up the delivery guys came in took one look at it and said that they didnt have the tools to take it away and they would have to rearrange for someone else to collect! So, a few days later they collect it but i still didnt receive my fridge freezer!!!!Yesterday it was meant to be delivered but AGAIN the delivery guys have an excuse not to do their job.. They cant leave the truck, its too big to move etc... And again delivery was arranged for today, they turn up start looking for the fridge freezer to eventually be told they dont have on the lorry!! I have lost 7 days loss of earnings, god knows how much on phone calls to customer services who have been useless. Needless to say we have cancelled our order and taking our money to a compnay who knows what they are doing!!! We have waited a whole month in total just to get a fridge freezer!!!",2019-05-09
12,5cd3e7c7a843690a7cd05c67,"If you're looking for a branch of Curry's where customer knowledge and service is non existent then just pop into the Sydenham branch, you won't be disappointed by their general apathy and total lack of knowledge of the products that they sell.Apart from spending your time looking for a salesperson who is actually there to serve you (and that takes some doing) you will then struggle to find anyone that actually has any knowledge of the products that they are selling.Mostly the same products can be found at a branch of John Lewis where the customer service and product knowledge puts the Curry's staff to shame.Of course I can't say for sure that all branches of Curry's are of the same poor standard of the Sydenham branch in South East London but I certainly would look elsewhere for a more professional service and if you must buy from Curry's, choose another branch than Sydenham.",2019-05-09
13,5cd33a5aa843690a7cd02fea,I don't really need to write this i could just post links to hundreds of other customers who are explaining how currys are telling people there items are on the way..then explaining the driver is over his allowed hours or the van he is driving has broken down.This company must have shares in RAC the amount of times they brake down.It is quite obvious that they are using these excuses to myself and all customers to get the extra guaranteed amount out of us which is a lie.I was told the driver was 30mins from my home..then he was unable to fulfill my delivery as he had gone over his allowed driving time.I was told i could expect a delivery Sunday..this is wrong we are being lied to by this company.,2019-05-08
14,5cd3215ea8436908c4152c17,Bought a camera in Nov'18 and 2 months later it developed a fault - a few lines down the side of the screen. Returned it to Currys who sent it 4 days later to the manufacturer. In the 4 days it was in store it somehow developed an internal crack all the way across the screen. The manager said Currys are taking responsibility and now say they are not and that it was like that when I returned it despite nobody noticing it originally. Even the paperwork I have says different. The store say contact Head Office and Head Office say contact the store. Also the details of the sale and all emails cannot be found in their system. This has been ongoing for 3 months and I have had to involve a solicitor to resolve this. I'll never buy from Currys again. BEWARE - if you purchase anything just hope it does not malfunction as they will do everything to get out of it.,2019-05-08

I spoke to the delivery driver, and guided him to my house.200 metres away from my house, and six minutes later, he hung up and drove off saying that he couldn’t find my house. This was incredibly frustrating.Called up customer service, and they assured me that the appliance would be delivered between 3pm and 4pm. I called customer service again at 4pm, to be told that the driver was on his way to depot as he had finished his shift.Was offered Sunday delivery, and then Friday delivery.SUNDAY AND FRIDAY ARE NOT WEDNESDAY. It’s unbelievable that someone who was 200 metres away from a house couldn’t find it, despite verbal instructions and even an annotated google maps picture.I need other appliances, but I’ll shop at a competitor who will actually deliver on their promises, and deliver what I purchased.",2019-05-08

18,5cd1eb7ca843690a7ccf9bfa,"Absolutely terrible! For your own sake, don't shop here!Spent an extra £10 to get next day delivery (via DPD), but they cancelled it without telling me. Only reason I found out was from DPD telling me that my delivery had been changed. Currys/PC World were perfectly happy to charge for a service they don't deliver on! Ended up getting my money back for the next day delivery, but we had to ask them to give it back, not the other way around.Very disappointed - don't be fooled by their generally lower prices for stuff. Steer well clear. Trust me, Amazon is bound to be better.",2019-05-07
19,5cd1c2b1a8436908c4148dae,"I bought fitbit versa from the currys store at Westfield whitecity. When I bought they were on the counter ready to sell the product to me. The very next day I had to exchange my watch as the screen was not working. Again after 1 month the button on the side stoped working so I tried to exchange it in Westfield but currys employees not too helpful. The only option i was given is exchange the product but the did not have the product. He said he cannot order it for me but the store will contact me with in 2 weeks when they have stock and gave me their contact details of the store and told me to call after 2 to 3 days. When I called the number I could not place any phone on that number. So I looked up online and contacted the currys team. They said to me that the store had no number so I don't know why I was given a fake number in the first place. They said me to go to store. I could not go to the store so i send a family friend but people in currys said they have no idea and to wait till 2pm. However, my friend had to go work so he returned but they said to him to go tob the store that has stock when u check online. I had the watch for 3 weeks but i received no call from the store from white city westfield. So i went to store in finsbury because online it showes had in stock but they did not have so referred me to go to Oxford street as it showed it had 1 in stock. So when I went there, they said there was no stock and did not bother to check it. If they did not have stock why was I told to go there.They told me the only thing i can do is to order the stock there. Now I still have to wait 2 to 5 days. On top of that they cannot do delivery to my house they said. It will take 1 and half hour by train just to get the watch. So I think it is not worth it but I have no option that to wait for it. They were in hurry to take money when I bought it but now they don't give a dame when I need to exchange it. Not so helpful as they have been sending me different store.",2019-05-07

21,5ccd88b1a843690564fcc877,Advice - when buying online make sure you take a screen shot. I bought an integrated washer/dryer with money off and extended 5 year guarantee. The extended guarantee was the key factor in my buying decision. Machine arrived but no details of guarantee - after 60 minutes on the phone to 5 different departments they are telling me the guarantee was not offered and can not help in any way.

I have attempted to put an item in the ""search"" bar, but despite trying loads of times - it is impossible.I have also tried activating the filter but nothing happens. I used to have no problems with accessing items I was interested in so what on earth have Currys done!!If Currys want people to make the whole experience of finding/buying items from them simple then please, please get them to sort the website out. The way it is working is very, very frustrating. I will try somebody else whose website is much easier to use.",2019-05-04
23,5ccd4a78a8436908c412f6bf,"Put a gun to my head over the cancellation/ E-gift card purchase. So recently a burglary took place at my flat in which a number of items got stolen. A traumatic time for my partner and I. I had the option of Amazon vouchers but instead I opted for the currys/pcworld gift card option because there were a number of desirable replacements that had caught my eye online. I went online and purchased 5 items one evening and thought all was rosy and looking forward to my Sunday delivery. However on the Saturday morning I noticed that one item (Anker sound core speaker) was an inferior model to the one I had previously and more expensive than on Amazon. I called the ""Know how"" team and asked if this part of my order could be cancelled a refund of £49.99 and proceed with the delivery of the rest of the order totalling £1416.99. I was told that the only way I could receive the refund was primarily in E vouchers, despite spending an additional £190 with Currys on my debit card, on top of my £1276 e-gift. I didn't want the speaker back on credit/gift card it was just a simply mistake. Now I have to wait 3-5 working days for the vouchers to come through the post (although despite this advertisement in their cancellation email, over the phone I was told it could take up to 7days). False advertising. So due to Currys/PC worlds contorted refund policy I will now have to wait 1-2 weeks before I can get the items I ordered. I will undoubtedly end up spending less at Currys/PCworld as a result due to the bitter taste this process has left in my mouth. So instead on that additional £190 profit they could have had I will no longer get the bose speaker system I had intended to purchase out of principle. The ""Knowhow"" team/Currys could have provided better customer service during what should be a nice shopping experience after the trauma of a burglary. Also if Currys/PC world were such a stickler for refunding in the manner which it was purchased, then why didn't I get my E-gift voucher in the manner in which I was given it ie back email. I will reconsider buying from elsewhere ie Amazon in the future, less stress. I will also feed the experience back to my home insurance provider in the hope they choose to work with a more professional outfit in the future.",2019-05-04
24,5ccc8ecca8436908c412ccc2,"Didnt like the conduct of the female Assistant in (Parkgate Branch). I really dislike them trying to hard sell additional repair cover products anyway, but to be looked at and spoke to in a way that you’ve done something wrong for not taking it out is discusting and then after saying no, she brought it back up before I left. The Assistant made my purchase uncomfortable and I will shop elsewhere in future.Currys need to look at who they employ and how they train their staff. I had a similar issue with PC world trying to sell Antivirus software and recall feeling uncomfortable then too, so not an isolated caseOnly gets 2 star because the guy who brought the item to my car was ok, but then again, he didnt have to sell anything.",2019-05-03

Arrive home, try to order online but item 'Not available for delivery' and is 'Pick up only' – but not at my local store, a store 50 miles away!!Try to phone my local store to discuss the matter and request that product is sent from store-to-store, but all calls are handled by a Sheffield-based call centre where the staff couldn't be any less helpful and will do EVERYTHING in their power to stop you being able to speak to anyone from your local store. I'm rudely informed by one call handler that products cannot be transferred between stores anyway so the store wouldn't want to speak to me. I try again, and a slightly more friendly call handler instructs me that if I visit my local store and place the order there, the product CAN be transferred. So I make another trip my local store, only to be told that is not true. I give up, I have never found it so difficult to spend £300 with a company. I find it obscene that you cannot, without much much difficulty, speak to your local store on the phone. A faceless and soulless company with no interest whatsoever in looking after customers.

It finally turned up at 5.15pm and the goods were damaged. 3rd Failed Delivery Slot !!!Curry's own driver said they get it all the time and claimed his vehicle was often overloaded with jobs so there were daily failed delivery's. Offered 15% discount for the damaged oven and after complaining £ 70.00 compensation with the manager assuring me they would phone next day for my BACS details.All I got was more excuses from their customer service centre saying it takes 30 days to do a BACS transfer.

Their customer service centre said that didn't count as they deliver 7 days a week !!!!Compensation for breach of contract and out of pocket expenses as a result of not fulfilling a companies obligations is a consumer right. I will give them 7 days to resolve my legitimate causes for complaint and then issue a claim in the small claims court.Other buyers should be aware and read feedback on any company before placing orders , once they have your money, they do not seem interested in providing a high level of customer services.In my case Know how , just didn't know how",2019-05-02
30,5ccae6f1a8436908c4120a46,"We have just experienced our first so called valet service and all we can say is don’t waste your money it was anything but a service and was certainly NOT a valet and we have large number of pictures to prove it. Let down, told lies and left with a non working fridge drinks dispenser, after a so called valet by a so called knowhow operative, who didn’t knowhow to clean it so didn’t bother to even try, then told us he was going to arrange for an engineer to call and deal with it, but as this was over a week ago and we haven’t heard from Curry’s we must assume just another lie and that hasn’t been arranged either. This misery started Just over a year ago when our fridge/freezer broke and we headed to Curry’s for a replacement. After speaking with some helpful shop staff we decided on an American unit as a good deal was being offered, but after 3 failed delivery attempts one due to rain, yes we were told they couldn’t deliver because it had been raining!!! so we gave up and got a refund. Still needing a fridge/freezer we were drawn back by a deal on a normal Samsung unit. Having explained our previous poor experience to the manager we were assured of delivery first time and our broken unit was taken away as a good will gesture. So far so good and with the new unit we took out a 5 year service plan. We were advised each year the unit would be cleaned and receive an anti bacterial treatment. We mentioned our concerns about the drinks dispenser and previous experience with poor functioning after a period of time and were told all would be sorted as a part of the annual Valet service. When the operative arrived we mentioned that the drinks dispenser was not working properly, to be told sorry I can’t touch that you will need to get an engineer out, “TO CLEAN A DRINKS DISPENSER” we thought you are joking? Well he wasn’t because he never even looked at it let alone clean it, what a waste of time? After less than 20 minutes 10 of which was spent on his phone and speaking to my son and he was gone. We had a look before putting anything back in the fridge/freezer only to discover little to nothing had been cleaned so my son and his partner spent the next hour cleaning it properly before we could refill it. We decided to write and complain about your failure to deliver the level of service suggested by your staff at the time the agreement was made being that the fridge /freezer would be cleaned to a high standard with anti bacterial products and the water dispenser would be checked, cleaned and fully functional on completion. Of which none of the above was true. When deciding to write this review we had no idea of the scale of customer failures Curry’s were responsible for, more than 60% of customers being dissatisfied, beginning to look like Comet and we know what happened there? Take note DSG Retail, no customers no business and it seems you are losing them fast to companies like “AO.com” online. A decent retailer having failed to meet the standards their own contract implies would compensate the customer for the time and trouble in preparing the fridge /freezer for cleaning and offer a full refund of money paid? We will see?",2019-05-02

Bought a fridge freezer onlineWe were given a delivery slot of Sunday 14th April 13:40 - 17:40 After hearing nothing, I rang customer services at 17:36 and was informed there were still two deliveries ahead of me and could expect a new time of approx. 18:30 and a phone call when the delivery people were arriving at the job before me After hearing nothing, I attempted to ring at 18:22 with the only contact number I could find, customer services, however this was closed I get a call at 20:03 to be informed the delivery vehicle had apparently broken down so would not be delivering this evening, and we should have already had a call to inform us of this. We could expect to be the first delivery on Monday 15th at approx. 8:30 (although no guarantee or assurance could be given) with the delivery people starting their shift at 7am in Buckinghamshire - I reluctantly agree to this despite knowing this will make me an hour late to work as I don't actually have any other options. I checked the traffic in the morning and it was 'lighter than usual' so expected the driver to arrive between 8am-8:30am After hearing nothing, I call customer services at 8:15 to be told we were actually the second delivery of the day and could expect an arrival at approx. 9:30. I raised the issue of yesterdays agreement we would be the first delivery. The customer services agent double checked with the depot and the excuse was now we were the first delivery however the driver had a delayed start to the day. The delivery team finally arrive at 8:59I make my complaint and mention getting compensation for missing work for the delivery and having a further day without the fridgeI am offered £20 - which is less than 5% of my purchaseI suggest £40 is a more genuine gesture of goodwillThey offer £30On the 17th April I was told it would take 3-5 daysAfter chasing, on the 30th April I was told it would take 5-7 daysThey still haven't contacted me to ask for payment details of where to send the so called gesture of good will so I don't hold much hope for this 5-7 days (I payed with gift cards and PayPal)John Lewis price match, I strongly suggest using them or ANYBODY else instead",2019-05-02

The item was only a week old and ***** was back on the case moving the goal posts saying that even though the item had been returned within the timescale he still would not do anything as the item had been used. The item HAD to be used to find out it was not as sold and secondly faulty. Wayne became quite rude, calling a ""a liar"" and that I was ""WRONG"". At any point during this exchange I was nothing more than assertive, I told Wayne that he was out of order speaking to me that way he did and yet he persisted. I politely asked him to remove himself from the conversation as he wasn't helping. In turn he then threatened to have me removed from the store. ANGRY does not cover it. I made a point of telling *****I would be taking this matter further and he just said quite smuggly that he was just working within company policy. So he believes company policy is to threaten customers when they aren't happy with the service he is providing? The man is a disgrace to your company and to customer service as a whole.I work in a busy NHS payroll department and if we spoke to any colleague or employee in that manner, no matter what the circumstances, we would be taken down a disciplinary route for gross misconduct with dismissal likely.

The review below shows our ongoing saga. Nearly 1 week in, 2 days off work, and 2 faulty dishwashers later and we are at an impasse. They delivered a damaged dishwasher. The knowhow helpline offered either 10% off or a new delivery which would mean another day off work, with no compensation at all. I asked them to offer free installation as we have had to take the time to try and fit the faulty goods, but they refused. Absolutely fuming. Never use Currys. John Lewis have excellent customer service.Update 1: We installed the faulty dishwasher and it flooded our brand new kitchen. We eventually managed to talk to a helpful advisor called Owen who arranged for a replacement and complementary installation. All seemed good...Update 2: However, the replacement is also damaged. After 40 minutes on the phone and talking to 6 different people, we were told they could not help us and we had to go into store (despite the knowhow team arranging the previous replacement...). We went into store and spoke to someone who then could not get through the depot to arrange a second exchange.

45,5cc85c08a8436908c410ff15,"Ordered a fridge and washing machine to be delivered on Monday. The delivery guy turned up and said he thinks the fridge might be too big for the gap (not currys’ fault, the previous owner of the house gave us wrong measurements) and that he wouldn’t be able to take the fridge back if he unloaded and unpacked it so we decided to let it go back. 5 minutes later he comes back in and says it’s not our lucky day, the washing machine is broken, so they drive off with both the fridge and washing machine. We rang curry’s that day to rearrange delivery of the washing machine and ordered a new fridge that we knew would fit. We were told this wasn’t a problem at all and we would get both on the next day. The next day (this morning) the delivery guy (a different one this time) turns up, I show him into the kitchen, point at the gap and say “this is where the fridge goes”. He looks at me confused and goes “Fridge? I only have a washing machine.” He didn’t know anything about the confirmed order and the fridge wasn’t on a different van either! But that isn’t all, 5 minutes later, at this point I was already more than irritated, he comes back to tell me that the washing machine is broken. Wait, what? AGAIN? I then rang curry’s to rearrange delivery of both goods but even though it was only 9.30 in the morning and it was their fault they said they couldn’t deliver today, so we arranged delivery for tomorrow. There’s nothing else for me to do now than pray that they are delivering both goods tomorrow, not just because the food on our kitchen counter has seen better days and the dirty clothes are piling up, tomorrow is also the last day that I am off, so if this doesn’t work out, they didn’t just waste my time and energy, it will then get even more stressful.Please Currys sort this out and I will consider revising my review.

51,5cc774a1a843690a7ccba3bc,"Arguably the worst customer service I have ever experienced from Currys Great Northern St Huddersfield. I bought a washing machine, given a deliver time of something like 7am-7pm, so inconvenienced myself by planning my day around this wide time. When the delivery man phoned me, he had a completely different address to mine, how??? However, he was in the same suberb and in fact 2 mins away from where I lived. However, I was advised my order is now cancelled and I would need to return to the store, get a refund and buy again. On telephoning the delivery department, they couldn't care less and when I pointed out this was dreadful customer service, the lady attempted to wind me up further by repeatedly wishing me a lovely day and offering no apology, just sticking rigidly to what ever un customer focussed procedure they had in place. So on arriving at the store, I was told I could not have a refund today as my product had not been returned to the depot.I find this behaviour from a well known company nothing short of a disgrace. Staff involved showed no regard for customer focus, instead showing breath taking arrogance and a complete lack of common sense. To deny my order when I was basically round the corner (a mistake entirely their own making) is beyond a joke. They were speaking to me live on the phone and could easily verify that I was the purchaser and correct a mistake of their own doing, I even had the receipt that I would have been able to show them, had they applied a bit of common sense, I absolutely do not understand their logic. Clearly staff who work here simply are not interested. It doesn't surprise me to read these absolutely appalling reviews on this site. Needless to say on eventually receiving my refund, I did not re-order and I have approached a competitor as I will always from now on.",2019-04-29
52,5cc753a4a843690b843757ef,"I sent this to CURRYS CEO via EMAI!! Am awaiting a responseSubject: Outrageous Customer Service from Currys - URGENTPLEASE RESPOND BY CLOSE OF BUSINESS 30TH APRIL 2019Dear Alexander,Since the 1st April 2019 I have had the most distressing experience with Currys ordering and execution of their “non” service!!On the 1st April 2019 I tried to order six white goods items from your website but was unable to complete the order as apparently your website cannot deal with large numbers of items being ordered simultaneously, which in itself seems ridiculous. I then contacted your online ordering team who said that I would have to order all the goods over the phone, but to enable certain discounts to be gained I would have to make three orders with two items on each order. I did this which was a very time consuming and tedious exercise and was sent emails of my order details and the agreed delivery date of 14th April -,apart from the fridge/freezer which I was told would be back in stock in a couple of days and somebody would call me with regard to the delivery of that single item.I made this order on behalf of both my disabled parents as I am their carer and they are unable to make such orders themselves - so I am arranging for a new kitchen to be fitted for them with all new appliances.My mother waited in on the 14th April for the delivery and was unable to come out with me to celebrate my birthday that day!! I was meant to be sent a txt message with regard to the delivery time on the 13th April, which I did not receive! I called customer services mid morning on 14th April to be told they had no record of my three orders being made let alone anything due to be delivered that day!! I was told by David (???) that the orders had been taken but not processed! He was absolutely dismayed at the situation and apologised, agreeing how disgruntled and upset I was at the whole situation! Especially trying to sort this out on a weekend away for my birthday and my poor parents distraught as they were having a kitchen fitted with no goods!!I was given the above customer case number and promised that all goods would be ordered and the gentleman I spoke to would make it “priority” with the online orders team and that I would get a call with regard to a new delivery date. I was also promised compensation due to the upset, distress and bad service from Currys.I did not feel overly comfortable with the situation so I called Currys the next day 15th April - I was put on hold as soon as I mentioned my case number, after 1 hour 45 minutes of being put through to different people I was eventually told by another lady on the customer help desk that even though Currys had taken my money £1,530.00 on 1st April none of my orders had been processed and were “stuck” in the system. Is that good practise? Is that legal? She said that there was a department dealing with this situation and it could take 3-5 days before somebody got back to me to see if any of the products could be ordered or were even in stock!!!! As you can imagine by this time I was nearly in tears and so upset!! The lady agreed that the only option was to cancel all three orders and get a refund. I was told that the monies would be refunded to my credit card within 3-5 working days so that I had the funds to purchase goods elsewhere.Eight days later!!! The monies had still not been credited to my account and my credit card was due to be paid! I called Currys customer services and spoke to David Moss at (staff ID number 12242) who put me on hold again for 20 minutes trying to resolve the fact that I still had not been refunded and Currys had held my money now for 25 days!!! David informed me that the orders had “NOT” automatically been refunded by the system and he could not understand why!!! This was just one incompetence after another! He assured me that he had made manual BACS payments for all three orders and he would forward them to the finance department for refunds to be made. He fully agreed that the whole situation was disgraceful and could understand my distress. I had to again ask about compensation and he asked a manager in his area and all they could offer would be 5% off of any future purchases or £20.00 credited to me ‘somehow?’ Bearing in mind the untold stress, possible interest charges to my credit card bill and hours of telephone calls, not to mention my own time that I have lost, this offer was unacceptable. I asked for a customer services Manager to call me back as soon as possible to discuss the whole situation and was told somebody would call me in the next three hours.Natasha Reyman did call me and was completely on the defensive during most of the call sighting that “computer” error was to blame and that it was not human error. This is completely unacceptable in today’s age of computer generated orders/payments etc. and all I got was a “sorry” for the way things had gone. Her attitude towards me was very complacent and she showed no compassion nor remorse to my customer experience. Natasha assured me that she would “keep and eye on the situation and call me back by the end of the following week” with regard to the “REFUND” and compensation. In summary Alexander, it is now the 29th April and Currys have held my money for almost a month now. The Currys staff have been nothing but incompetent in trying to resolve what is clearly a simple task, one which is evidenced with multiple failings, and then they show disdain to the customer as if to say we are not important in your retail business modelPlease refund my money with immediate effect. Please investigate my case and please review the customer service of your staff and confirm whether you believe it meets your standards. I expect your immediate response.Regards,Victoria",2019-04-29

71,5cc307a5a8436908c40f47ef,"I visited Currys to collect an item for my 90 year old grandmother which was already paid for and I had received the code via email in order to collect the parcel. The lady serving me informed me that I needed the last four digits of the payment card to get the parcel even though it was paid for in full and I had a code that was sent direct to my email. I informed her that my nanna was 90 and it was for her and she is very frail and can't read very well, hence the point I am collecting it from store and not having it delivered to her house as she struggles to move. She then asked a manager to help to see if there was anything that could be done without calling her as she is very old and it could endanger her trying to find her purse etc as she may fall. The manager who came to ''help' was named Dave and he was one of the managers on on duty at the Southport meols cop branch on the 26/04/19. His attitude from the beginning was appalling and very arrogant. When I explained the situation to him his attitude again very arrogant and said if i ring her she's very frail etc he just looked at me and said. Yeh.... And continued with his attitude. At this point I was very angry and said well I'll ring her if she falls it's your fault .he then got even more on his high horse and said well i don't think it is, and as my nanna answered proceeded to talk extremely loudly almost into my ear so much so I couldn't hear what my grandmother was saying, eventually he flounced off which to be honest I was very glad of as the lady serving me was very helpful. It's just such a shame that the company are promoting people like this who obviously just like the power and have clearly adapted an attitude to match. I would really appreciate if Currys at Southport could speak to their manager Dave about this incident and perhaps give him some more training in customer service as he clearly isn't very good at this aspect of his job.",2019-04-26

82,5cc0c9d0a843690a7cc96e65,"Bought a tv on which the internet connection failed. The store refused to accept the tv back for repair as it was outside their returns period of 21 days and left us to take the matter up with the manufacturer ourselves. We arranged for the tv to go to the manufacturer whose technicians confirmed that there was a recognised software problem with this product and a fix was unlikely, if ever, to be found. The customer services dept insisted that contrary to what the technical people were telling us, the tv had been repaired. It came back with the same fault as before. There then followed a succession of fruitless emails in which Currys insisted first that we should wait for the imminent fix which was being prepared and then, when we persisted in asking for our money back, that they had no liability as we were outside the '21 day returns policy'. We know that customers can, in law, return defective goods within 30 days not 21. Further, any fault arising within 6 months (in our case it was within that time limit) is deemed to have existed on purchase. Currys have no defence, yet they brazenly asserted 'not our problem'.The service from Currys is the worst my wife and I have ever experienced in over 40 years of shopping. Their website claims to take customer complaints seriously and to work with manufacturers to ensure customers are not inconvenienced. This is false. In our case they seem to have a policy of obstruction and providing deliberately false information about the facts and their legal obligations.",2019-04-24

They said as the TV was now working I was not entitled to it.I then said OK if the problem develops again after already bringing it back within the 30 days, would I be able to get a refund .There answer ..NO.I wouldn't but a battery from this place the're nothing but a bunch of con artists out to get your hard earned cash.As a bye note I also checked the problem online to see if other Sony TV owners had the problem and sure enough they had.This I also informed the member of staff (Majek) but he couldn't give a toss no doubt looking after his bonus .25/04/2019 .After posting this review Currys have posted a reply on Trust Pilot.They have also apologised for the service I received and asked for details. I've done this and also sent them a link highlighting the problem with Sony TV'S online.I'm now awaiting there decision02/05/2019After being fobbed off by Currys customer services over 2 weeks, asking for email addresses, Customer name ,Telephone number ,date of purchase etc etc they finally turn round with the lame excuse that each store acts independently.

Curry's have been nothing but a nightmare to deal with, they have failed to deliver and install this item on three separate occasions over this time, each time I've waited in all day for it as they don't do specific times - and are now asking to do it for a fourth time next week! (To be fair, they did install the dishwasher on one of the visits!). Each time they have told me the item is correct and will be installed, and each time a different set of installer turn up and are either not qualified to do the installation or say it's the wrong item and it does not fit - but Curry staff have advised me ever time on what to get - they clearly have no idea what they are doing or the installers don't - probably both TBH? I've spoken to at least half a dozen different people, been onto their HO, had guarantees of it get sorted by ""managers"" - nope, still waiting, just getting fobbed off again and again. This company really should be dealt with by the watchdog, but it apparently does not have much in the way of teeth, so all I can do is implore potential customers - DON'T DO IT!UPDATE - Almost two weeks later and it's still not sorted - yet another visit booked in for next week - it will now be around 7 weeks since I placed the order...…...I must have been mad to use Currys after experiencing their service in the past, but you think perhaps kit was just a one off...…..No, this is their regular go to place if things can't get done in their automated way, the system just falls to bits as their managers and staff simply cannot cope with thinking for themselves.",2019-05-04

113,5cbb00aba8436908c40c97b0,"Staff at the Chatham store are telling customers they will need to pay a £60 charge if it turns out to be a software fault, even when the items are less that 12 months old, they do not understand that an item purchased from them it is upto them to cover costs to repair a faulty item for the first year, on 27th March took my PC in for repair (4 months old, job number 575764) phoned and said it was a software fault, they hadn't even sent to tech team, and I would need to agree to pay a £60 charge, I refused, got in touch with knowhow team through Facebook eventually (hours later) finally they admitted I was correct and shouldn't need to pay and told me the store was sending it off. I waited until the 8th April and phoned the store, they said they called on 28th March, 2nd April and 8th April and left messages, they hadn't even sent it off and she told me I should answer my phone, I have my phone on me all the time and if I had missed any calls I would have a notification, I checked the logs for the days she said, no missed calls!! I honed the tech team and they arranged for it to be collected from me on 11th April.I collected it from the Store on 10th April, had a word with the Manager, she also was saying the guarantee is with the manufacturer. 11th April it was collected from me, 14th April I got a text saying they where returning it to me as it has to goto the manufacturer for repair, I phoned them and was told that as it wasn't a software fault, HP would need to do the repair, I was told they couldn't send it straight to them and I would have to take it into the store, I explained what happened last time I did that and he said there should be a docket in with it, or if not tell them to look up the job number'622713'. I had a text saying they would be delivering between 15:00 and 19:00 on 16th April, I made sure I was back and nothing came, again I messaged on Facebook, they couldn't find out what was happening with it, then on 18th I got a message saying they would be delivering it on 19th April(Good Friday) between 07:30 and 11:30, it turned up at 11:50, no docket in with it so again I messaged on Facebook to confirm that if I took it into the store they would not cause me any more hastle, Ollie said that he had sent them an email to inform them what to do, so I took it back to the store, I was in there quite a while, the assistant read the email, but couldn't find how to get it sent straight to HP, so she did a normal docket and said she would phone me when it was sorted, also that it would not be sent off until Tuesday and they usually take 7-10 days. She also told me that usually they do all of the HP repairs as they are the repair centre for HP, she did not believe me when I told her that they can only repair Laptops, and started saying about software not being covered, I told her that I wasn't getting into that argument again and left the store. Not long after I was shopping when I got a phone call from the store and said that I need to agree to pay a £60 fee if it turned out to be a software fault!!! So I am back now to the same day I first took it in for repair.I have messaged again on Facebook, saying I now want a replacement as Monday will be 28 days from when they should have been dealing with the repair for my PC, and as it will now at the earliest sent out on Tuesday will take a lot longer (that is if the store send it). They cam back ignoring my request saying that it will be sent off. I told them not good enough and do the right (legal) thing, and not to make me keep going through the laws with them.Of course there is a lot more to this as I have tried to shorten it, basically Chatham store (maybe all others) are extorting money from customers to pay for repairs they shouldn't have to pay for.I was told that someone had had a word with the store over this matter of consumer rights and who is responsible for the repairs, my complaint number isCC3945530, but no idea what was said.For anyone else reading this check out the consumer rights act 2015, some things have changed and now you are also covered for digital content, and also if you have a fault develop in a product within the first 6 months it is deemed to be faulty from the date of purchase, and is upto the store to prove otherwise, also by law you need to let then have 28 days to do the repair, and then you are entitled to a refund or replacement, in this case I want a replacement as I purchased it when it was on sale and would cost me more for another PC with the same spec.RE your reply: Your social media team, obviously don't know consumer rights, I am going around in circles, now he is offering to pay the £60 charge for me, which has already been confirmed by a different person on 28th March I don't need to pay as software is covered by Curry's warranty who I bought my PC from.

A stated they was going to discuss the issue further with another member of staff. A went away but after waiting some minutes I followed in their directionI met her addressing Ricardo Huggins. A explained to him that the Knowhow team had informed them the job ticket indicated ""complete"" therefore they was at loss on how to refund the payment. I expressed my disagreement that the job had not been completed and that the engineer should be asked because I have their mobile phone number on which they had called me prior to and after the scheduled job. At this point Ricardo Huggins stated ""You don't need to get on your high horse about this"". I was shocked at this response and said to him that he should not address a client as such. To which he replied ""Well I just did!"".For me his second statement does not indicate his remorse of the first. There was also his boldness of making these statements in front of two other staff; A and B - a business manager. Mr Huggins behaviour implies it is okay to speak in such a manner to customers.My details were left behind for the refund to be investigated but I left the store very dissatisfied with the treatment that was meted out to me by Mr Huggins.This issue was reported to Customer services but to date 19 April 2019 no satisfactory response apart from my refund being processed.",2019-04-19

Reserved it and drove 50 miles and an hour and a half away from my home. When I arrived at store I started to smell a rat. The sales man repeatedly tried to sell me an alternative product. I explained my wife had selected the item as it had the best review and that was the one I was here for. He tried to divert me. That he could not find reservation or product. He then took me to a lesser product and told me it was substandard and he could sell me a better washing machine that was on sale for £90 more. I told him “ The wife has reserved and sent me for this washing machine and therefore that was the washing machine I was to come home with. While he was still trying to sell me the alternative washing machine. I walked 2 down the line. There it was. The washing machine my wife longed after. He scanned it and told me that was the only one they had left and he could not sell it to me. I had lost patience. And told him I knew this was going to happen and left the store. I rang Currys who told me that the store had 2 in stock. So they were trying to sell me a more expensive model or they had already sold the model I had reserved. I started to make a complaint but thought I had already wasted enough time on Currys. I immediately took to the Internet and found a local store who could supply an equivalent model for £60 cheaper.

The first experience was with carphone warehouse in currys. Took on a phone contract but the phone was not in store. Went home and then got a better offer. On collection day I went to the store and told them I actually do not want the phone. I had not even seen the phone by that time talk less about touching it. Their excuse was that the phone counts now as used and they cannot resell it.also once my contract had been activated there is no way of cancelling. After 15 minutes of arguing I gave in. Went home and installed the phone. I tried to make a call but it didnt work. I tried to send SMS but nothing! So the next day I rung the network provider and was told my contract has not yet been activated! I had to go back to the store again to get it activated. As an apology I got a pathetic 10£ gift card.Second experience was a staff who sold me a washing machine. I told him the machine had 'pause and add' but he was convinced it wasnt! At home I pause the machine any time and add items! I dont even have the words to explain the fuss he made about a basic cash card we used for direct debits.3. Time buying a TV. An over enthusiastic man talked us into getting a sound bar with the TV because according to him my surround system at home would not work with it. Then he grabbed a cable that cost 59£ and said we would need this and he will make it a generous half price. Otherwise the soundbar wont work. When I asked for a cheaper one he told us that there is one but it's not as good and not in stock. So after he pushed us into buying all that we went home and opened the speaker but were not happy about it because it's too big and also my surround system actually works with the TV. So we went back to return the TV and the posh cable and, oh surprise, it cant be returned cause it was opened and that's against their 'policy'.

I quoted my statutory rights.I asked about the one in twenty free promotion they were advertising and they said they did not do this. I showed them the advert and they told me it was Dyson's promotion. Wrong It was theirs.The Dyson I bought was faulty so I took it back within about 3 weeks. They pretended to phone Dyson and then said that Dysdon would only repair. I went home and checked the consumer law and went back next day and demanded a replacement as it was within 30 days.While in store a customer was being fobbed off with the same story about can only offer a repair.They insisted on keeping the original receipt so now I can't claim the promotional offer.The staff are obviously trained to lie about people's statutory rights.The only reason I went to Currys was because of the 1 in 20 offer. Everybody is charging the same price. I wouldn't have had this bother with Amazon, not to mention three 15 mile round trips.",2019-04-18
131,5cb85d3aa8436908c40bc2fa,Terrible. Beyond awful.I went in store and decided which Canon printer I wanted and went home to check the size of the MG3650.Curry's website states: The black one is: 390 H x 226 W x 501 DThe white one is: 152 H x 449 W x 304 DNo matter how you look at those numbers it's easy to see there's something wrong with the sizing. I rang the customer services department to say I would have liked to order online but needed the sizes confirming. The advice was to either go back to the store or order and return it if the sizing was incorrect.I previously had to return a tall freezer because it was some 10 to 15 cm shorter than stated and I'd bought it because the height was important.,2019-04-18
132,5cb850a6a843690a7cc6ae60,"Waste of my time. Went to the Currys store in Carmarthen and talked to a sales advisor in store who had very little information about the televisions sold in store and passed me on to an “expert”. He knew less than we had read online, demonstrating either a very poor level of staff training or a total lack of respect for the job, and I really don’t care how little he is paid, it is my opinion that if you don’t do your job properly then you really don’t deserve it. Anyway, the latest televisions are not in the store for customers to see so a day trip was a waste of time and I ordered online, left my email and phone number and waited in for 12 hours the next day. When the tv did not arrive, no call or email to let me know so whole day wasted, I called customer services who said that they had received the payment but would not be delivering the tv but could not say why they had not and that I would have to return to the store to find out why (I didn’t order in store and they were no help). They claimed they had sent me an email-blatant lie as I kept the pages with my details and nothing was sent to me. The whole experience left me wondering how this can be considered a business model that considers their customers? It turns out that AO sell the same tv with a different code-allowing Currys to not have to price match their products (shameful ripoff tactics). So I have ordered the same product from AO for the same price without the embarrassment of dealing with Currys staff and it has arrived when they said it would. I cannot over emphasise the stress and boredom, not to mention money lost by taking time off waiting for nothing, that Currys have caused. I will not only never use or recommend them again but will ensure that the many thousands of followers I have are aware of the poor service Currys provide. Ste T",2019-04-18

On Friday I purchased a 65 inch lg tv in store ( I waited over an hour to be served , the sales man I approached had just disappeared ) I arranged a delivery for Monday with a 5 hour delivery slot , when nothing arrived I called only to be told that I canceled my order ! After few minutes of insisting that this is not true , I was advised that this was a wrong input I did not cancel the order (really ?) and that they had to use a different delivery team and my tv will be delivered anytime up to 2230 that day . Having stayed up yet again nothing arrived .The following day I went to the store 30 minutes drive from my house , they simply rang the delivery and advised that the delivery has been rescheduled for Wedensday , no compensation offered no apologies . I rang customer services and demanded compensation , I requested and received a free fitting to the wall service and would have been satisfied with this , if only they would have showed up on Wedensday as promised . Again a whole day was wasted waiting in vain . 2 working days lost for incompetence service . As a business customer dealing with properties we order many white goods through currys and we will no longer use this company . To add insult to injury they just sent another text saying; good news your item is in stock and will be delivered on the 23rd !!!Their telephone customers service is also lacking, you wait for ages on the line , often get cut off , and finally when you speak to someone they are not helpful at all .

First I brought a washer 3 months later it stopped heating up this happened 3 times which is not great for a brand new washer but didn't think much about it. So last August 2018 I again went to curry's and brought a fridge freezer yesterday that too as stopped working. Not great as it's practically new just 8 months old. Just too add my sister also brought a vax hoover 2 weeks ago that as also broke the brushers won't spin. Somthing just isn't right with your appliances.

I booked the day off work for this.Due to a fault of my own by the person who brought this Fridge for me as a gift, the wrong telephone number for me was given at the time of online purchase. This was quickly noticed and I passed over the correct number on the phone to one of the customer services team.I also was given a more accurate time scale of delivery of between 12:45pm and 4:45pm.at 4.48pm I called again, and was told the driver was running an hour behind.Now at 7:15pm I decided to contact again, and I was told that the driver had broken down and ""tried to call me"" and that it has been rescheduled for Thursday 18th April. Obviously, you can quite understand my disappointment when I realised I had wasted a whole day's wages for a fridge that clearly was never coming.I appreciate the wrong number was given but WHY was no other form of communication tried, instead you left me wasting a day in, when I could of gone into work! I was then promised by Christopher Webb that it will arrive Thursday 18th, no later than when I start work at 11am and also given a complaint quote of :CC3957156.Oh how pointless that quote and conversation with Christopher Webb was.Now much to my disappointment today the unthinkable happened. I called the customer care team to find out what form of compensation I will receive as I do believe I deserve a lot at this point. I was then told that you have to wait for compensation until after your delivery takes place on the 23rd Tuesday.Sorry - THE 23RD?! I was promised tomorrow. I was lied to. Entirely lied to.I am now being told yet another date of next Tuesday.Firstly, what faith should I have that this fridge will even arrive? They have hardly filled me with any hope so far.Secondly, I cannot take yet another day off for this fridge. So I have been promised a delivery of before I start work again at 11am Tuesday 23rd.I am SO incredibly disappointed, frustrated and upset that I have been so let down by what I thought was such a good, well known and trustworthy company.Myself and all of my friends, family and social media accounts I have posted this on have all said they will never use Currys or PC World again.Oh, p.s not to mention Shauna on the Social Media team tried to fob me off with a £10 in store voucher, WOW!An update on 18th Thursday.I have since been told that the person who promised me the 23rd before 11am when I start work lied, and it is an another all day slot of 7am-7pm. I am so sick of their lies.ALSO, today I had a call from a unknown mobile number, I pick up. ""Hi its the currys delivery drivers we are 15 minutes away and are bringing your fridge""Obviously this made me very happy, but also laughable as does this company not communicate with one an other?!So they turn up, take away my old fridge and then try to leave me with half a fridge (the mini ones)...So I obviously state; umm no, I paid £160 for a fridge freezer?!Turns out they did not have my fridge AGAIN and Tuesday 23rd is apparently still the ETA.My god I have NEVER dealt with such a horrific shambles of a company.",2019-04-18

Delivery was arranged for seven days after the transaction was completed by debit card as we work in NHS/emergency services and this particular day was one when we'd be home. When the machine arrived, it was in a tatty white van, with matching scruffy, unshaven white van men. They said they couldn't install it as they weren't insured, and we would have to wait for a 'day or two -possibly a week' for an installer.We therefore refused to accept the dishwasher, as it's the eve of the Easter break, and it's a working one for us - no-one home. We immediately contacted Currys for an immediate refund as they were in breach of supply contract. They refused an immediate refund, because the paperwork would take time and the amount to be paid into our bank would depend on when it was released by theirs.It's not the first time Currys has fouled up - timethey went to the wall.",2019-04-17

I prefer a good refurbished one from a reliable seller on ebay. But I expected that they would, as a mass retailer, at least have good customer service, and expected that is why people buy from them.Am very disillusioned. My aunt still has an HP laptop she bought from John Lewis 8 years ago. Yet an HP laptop from Curry's fails in 15 months.

Then, today, I noticed that they are advertising the very same appliance for £580 on their eBay shop. It is advertised by them on the Currys eBay shop as brand new, not ‘new other’ or ‘manufacture tefurbished’. So, I thought no problem I will give them a call to tell them about this so I can get them to honour their price match promise, which they love shouting about.Now, bear in mind that this was exactly the same brand new item advertised by the exact same retailer so I assumed it would be absolutely no problem for them to honour the price that they themselves advertise. I called their customer service to explain the situation. Incredibly I was told that they do not actually honour price match on eBay, even if the item is brand new. Added to the fact that this item was being advertised at the lower price BY THEM, not a competitor. When I asked why, I was told that their EBay shop is an outlet store for customer returns so the condition of the item is ‘new other’ or ‘manufacturer tefurbished’. If that is the case, how can they mark the item as New? If these items are customer returns they are in breach of eBay policy.Anyway, unbelievably I have had to cancel my order as they just would not budge and were quite happy to lose a sale and a customer.Will not be using Currys ever again.",2019-04-17

No way to stay in the house and use this thing at the same time.Between waiting for it to 'bed in' (hoping the noise would stop) and it being the weekend I took it back four days later to the store it was bought from. Spoke to the manager who literally couldn't care less, he was extremely rude. Took my receipt, circled the Currys Customer Service (term used loosely) number and walked off, just before saying I should have contacted them before dragging the dryer back to the store.Utterly fed up I left the store, contacted 'customer service' the arrogant manager circled on my receipt and was told as it was bought in store there was nothing they could do - ""go back to the store you bought it from"". Very stressful and annoying that Currys would not take responsibilty for this. Whilst the law says you have 30 days for a refund (don't have to accept a replacement or repair) you do however have to prove there is a fault.The store decided they weren't going to do a damn thing until an engineer had confirmed that I was not lying. I was told if there was no problem with the dryer I would be billed £55 for the engineer visit. An attempt I believe to put me off getting a replacement/refund. Hotpoint engineer came within a couple of days and confirmed the fault. Attempted to repair (new motor) it but I refused on account of it being less than a week old and the arrogance of Currys. The engineer was first class and contacted Hotpoint for a reference number to allow me to return the dryer. They gave one but were very much cheesed off as they said they don't just call out to give a reference number, especially considering Currys have their own engineers.Managed to return the dryer within 20 minutes of having evidence of the fault, had a full refund and purchased a new one from a different company.All they had to do (being as the dryer was 4 days old) is use some common sense and give customer service, accept the returned item and give a replacement. To damn rude and arrogant to give any customer service. Shame Amazon didn't sell items like this directly, because any returns I have ever had to make with them, even up to a year later, has been replaced or refunded without ANY issues whatsoever. It's customer service like Currys that makes one hope they will be hit hard by people forever using a different company - except it will be the normal workers suffering when this happens.I will never use this outfit again, and if you want any form of customer service I would think twice, three times and then again before using this company.",2019-04-16

I was informed on 9 April that the item would be delivered on 15 April and received another text on 14 April giving a delivery time of between 10am and 2pm the following day. I had to arrange a day off from work so I would be in when the delivery arrived. On 14 April at around midday, I decided to track my order on the website to see what time it would be delivered. I was shocked to find that the delivery date had been changed to 25 April. I phoned customer services to ascertain whether this was a mistake and whether the item would still be delivered. I was told that the item couldn’t be delivered to my address as the street was too narrow and had been rescheduled as it would then be delivered in a van. Nobody had contacted me about this. It was also surprising as the street where I live is on a bus route and rubbish collection lorries have no problem getting up and down the road. I have also had other deliveries, e.g washing machines, furniture, delivered to this address, usually on lorries. I asked why the delivery driver hadn’t bothered to contact me as if he did I would have been able to confirm that the street was wide enough to drive a lorry down. However the customer service agent could not tell me why this had not happened. As it would not be possible for me to take another day off on 25 April to wait for the delivery I was left with no alternative but to cancel the order. I was, however, offered £30 compensation from Curry’s which doesn’t compensate for the loss of a day’s pay.

Contacted currys 2 days before Xmas holidays to be told there was nothing they could do, not even provide me with a loan TV so my sons Xmas would not be ruined without a TV and being able to use his Xmas gifts. TV was under warranty, which they tried to get out of, came to collect the TV and the driver said this fault was a common problem and they would just send us a new TV as he had seen done many times before. On the 26th Dec, got a text back saying my TV had been repaired and was being delivered back on the 27th. TV arrived back and had apparently had the power pack and TV screen replaced. However, once again my TV has stopped working with the same issue, which makes me doubt they carried out these works in the first place! To top it all off, as my TV was repaired under warranty, they only extend this by a further 90 days, which my TV is now conveniently out of this time frame!Called to speak to someone to say this is unacceptable that my TV is only 14 months old and has now broken TWICE with the same problem!! Clearly they haven’t fixed it as they claimed!Told that I have to pay £95 to have my TV collected and assessed. IF it’s found at fault, I get my £95 back and either the TV repaired or replaced or if my fault, then the charge stands, along with the repairs! I don’t see why I should have to pay money out for something you should have fixed properly in the first place! Seems to me like you did shoddy repairs to ensure my TV would not last, for me to then have to come back to you when it’s outside the 90 day time frame! I am so sick of this company getting away with ripping people off for faulty goods!What’s even more interesting is on your website, if I pay £95 for the initial assessment + parts, you then get a 12 month warranty for the works, yet when they have to cover costs under your warranty they only give you 90 days...likely because they don’t fix it properly to ensure they can screw you over for more money!I kindly quoted the sale of goods act to the advisor and as always they have their “get out clauses” to ensure they still get to take money off you to fix their faulty goods!As I said the last time from my review about your company, never will I use you again and neither have any friends or family since! I would rather pay a local tv repair company to fix this than give your scamming business another penny of my hard earned cash!Let’s see what poor excuse they respond with to this review off a cue card and their lame offer to help, which will no doubt be the same as the advisor I spoke to last night!

I have copies of every single email and all the replies that read like they have not read a single word i have written......... Aaaaarrrrrgh!!!!! ""While we try and stock 95% of replacement parts, the part we need to complete your repair is currently out of stock.

Paid £1500 for this tv and it has reached the point somebody has to take responsibility for it. Will keep updating this daily so it is always in Currys faces. Absolutely dreadful company and customer service is diabolical. Spend your money wisely, as in ""ELSEWHERE"" Purchased a £1500 philips oled tv online at Currys/pcworld. Had it less than a week when noticed a reverberation from speakers on bass sounds. Contacted Philips the day after. Philips sent various updates to my email in an attempt to fix problem. Eventually they sent out to technicians whom took the tv apart and noticed 2 screws missing from subwoofer mount. They found 2 random screws in the van and put these in. When tv was put back together noise was still there. Took tv apart again and put tape over all qnd any loose wiring inside. Again put tv back together and yet again no better.Now i have a £1500 tv that has 2 screws it may not need plus 20 metres of tape covering hot wires in the electronics. Yay.Contacted Philips day after to say it was no better and was told it was now a currys problem aaaargh. Contacted Currys for a replacement as tv was only 7 weeks old. Told they needed to try and repair it. I said Philips own technical team could not do it so how can you. Long story longer, apparently i should have approached Currys 1st to let them do it. They have now had tv for 10 days and said the subwoofer is dented so have ordered another....... Subwoofer was fine when Philips where here at my home to fix it. Only thing i can think of is when they come to pick it up the driver just picked it up and walked out with screen facing his jacket (nice one). I had to go out 2 mins later as i forgot to tape Philips technicians report to back of tv. Lo and behold my £1500 oled tv was balanced on its bottom corner on the floor of the van as they wrapped it in bloody bubble wrap. I was fuming. So it has probably got damaged in the back of the van.I happened to need a flat screen repairing i purchased at John Lewis a number if years ago. John Lewis arrived with a metal case with foam inside to protect tv. Currys just run out with it and bubble wrapped it.Customer satisfaction not. I have now been passed from pillar to post by Currys customer serv and teamknowhow. No one person will take responsibility. All i wanted was the set replacing. Now i want a refund so i can take my business and my hard earned cash to a store that thinks a bit more of it customers.As a further footnote, the below reply means absolutely nowt, smokescreen to give the effect they care. Spent the last 4 days chasing tv repair. Apparently still waiting for the subwoofer to be delivered. That they damaged. Still no return date for £1500 tv so been without for a fortnight now. Today I was informed when I get the tv back if it is still faulty they probably replace it. Joke so they are knowingly going to send it back broken. That is the whole top and bottom of it, replace tv and no more, wont even issue a refund. TV has been wrong since week 1 it is still less than 8 weeks old, Philips have looked at it, Currys have had the bloody thing for over 2 weeks and they are refusing a refund. WILL NEVER INTENTIONALLY USE THIS COMPANY AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",2019-04-15

165,5cb3a1f9a843690a7cc4dc58,"On the plus side, Currys PC World Nottingham have a superb range of electrical products and their website's pretty good.Their in-store customer service however is woefully inadequate.We went to buy a TV and spent a few minutes discussing the pro's and con's of their ""Exclusive"" 28"" TV. About 12 feet away and in full view were three assistants chatting (non-work-related topic). After around 3 minutes I walked towards them and got a half-grudging ""Can I help you"" response. Fair enough - not exactly over-keen, but a response of some sort at least.I asked if there were 28"" TVs other than the LG one shown; the guy said yes but they'd have to order them in. So there were other makes? Yes but no others on show. How wide is the 28"" TV? He didn't know and went to find out.In the meantime we walked around the corner of the display and found another 28"" TV a JVC. (Maybe they sneaked it in without telling him?)The JVC was ""HD Ready"" but the LG wasn't, according to the product info card. So when our guy returned, I asked him why.He said the LG in fact was, but the card was wrong.He also said he didn't know how wide they were because they couldn't find a tape measure. (What??) - Here's a tip to Currys/PC World staff. If you go to ""Currys.co.uk"", go to Search and enter the product code, then go to ""specifications"" it'll give you the sizes! I asked a couple of other minor questions, got waffle and gave up.We thanked him and checked other stuff we're looking to buy, but, as my wife said, ""there's no point in asking anyone for help"".So here's our advice: Go to Curry's PC World to see and compare products because their selection is very good. take photos of the spec sheets, then go to John Lewis or Argos for advice, and either buy from them or go online. Frankly, there's a glut of companies out there selling electrical products, even including supermarkets like Tesco and Sainsbury's and all will give a more professional and enthusiastic one-to-one service than Currys.",2019-04-14

I believe they are making it so difficult for consumers to get replacements or refunds that people eventually give up. I am in a situation where I was traveling in the UK and lost my kindle. I therefore asked Curry’s to deliver one to the hotel I was staying at. I paid extra for a particular time slot, waited an extra hour and a half for the kindle and was then forced to move on. I immediately notified Curry’s and surprisingly received no response. Currys had ample opportunity to telephone me or make contact to arrange for an alternative delivery address. That’s pushing them to far. I heard nothing from them.On my return home I then started the process of trying to get a refund. That’s a joke. So I send a formal letter stating that I was no longer in the country and to refund the money. What did they do they reissued a second kindle to the same address. I then had to notify them of their second stuff up, always waiting on the phone, clicking numbers, listening to some silly call centre operator with no decision making ability, no desire to resolve, giving you the same rubbish on the phone that you have received from the previous call centre operator. They then send me a note to say they are unable to read my refund letter because they don’t have the right software (adobe) to open the document .... sorry i thought the were called Currys PC!!!!! 2 months later I am waiting for my refund to be approved and they cannot, will not, should not, give me a refund date.....They have been sitting on my money for 2 months... They make it as difficult as possible for you to talk to them and when you do you are struck by the complete lack of care or interest of the people who eventually answer their phones. I am going to take this further because I believe they are actually behaving in a devious manner. I absolutely will not stop until someone gives me a clear answer for who is responsible for this organizations values. Lack of integrity seems to be at the heart of their business.",2019-04-14

When they did, the person didn't look like they belonged to the shop staff. They were in scruffy casual clothes, jeans and of an unkempt appearance. That wouldn't have been so bad if they had any ability to help me, which they didn't. First of all, once I'd provided the information I needed, they just disappeared off without telling me why or when they'd be back. When they did eventually return (which I suppose is something) they were negative and not able to provide useful information. And as I pointed out, the item wasn't in stock anyway! In the end, I went to another local show (JL) who not only have excellent and well-informed staff, also had the item in stock and it was cheaper than at Curry's!I should have known better than to go to Curry's in the first place.

Call received from delivery driver at 11:41, they left a message saying we will be with you in 20-30 mins. I phoned back and said no one will be home because the text said 2:15-6:15. They said ignore the text it’s wrong, you’ll have to reschedule delivery. I said why send a text with a specific time on it then? Nothing. I phoned customer services, I use this term loosely. The man I spoke to backed up the drivers response about the text, I asked why send it? Nothing. Phoned my wife who got through to someone else who was very helpful and said the delivery guys can fail a delivery until the time slot sent by the text. Basically if I’d rescheduled that would have been ok, but they were trying to get me to do it because they couldn’t until 2:15. They are job and done, I was their last drop!! Anyway, they phoned me again at 1pm to ask if I was home, I wasn’t as I’d previously told them I wouldn’t be home until 2. He said let me check if that’s ok, now I knew this was ok as for armed is for warned and all that. He called back to say can you call me when you’re home. I said I would and did just that at 1:50.

After informing him of what had happened he kindly refunded the delivery charge. It’s now 8 days and that money hasn’t turned up in my bank account.

The customer service from this company is shocking. Staff are rude, refuse to give you contact details of anybody that you can escalate your complaint to. ABSOLUTELY HORRENDOUS! To top it off we have purchased a lot from this company in the past couple of years, so to receive this level of customer service off them now is like a slap in the face!!! 😡 will never ever purchase anything from this company again. Will be heading to John Lewis where I have found the customer service to be great. Just wish I had read the reviews on this company before making any purchase from them. Lesson learned.",2019-04-11

I was told that this was not a problem and that the machine I was thinking of buying was on display 'for you to play with'. I then visited the Inverness store and was told in store very rudely that this was not possible, and that Curry's did not open boxes but on;ly sold new machines. Needless to say there were 3-4 Blu Ray machines out on display, I do hope these will not subsequently be passed off as new. When I told the assistant that I had phoned customer services and been told that a demo would not be a problem I was told curtly that customer services got it wrong.",2019-04-11
199,5caf05afa843690a301bd5bd,"We ordered a dishwasher that was delivered and installed by two men from Teamknowhow. They left the machine running but did not check it was operating correctly before they left. After waiting some time we noticed that nothing seemed to be happening, so we opened its door and saw it was registering a fault. The manual said this could be caused by a faulty water supply or the feed pipe being blocked or twisted. The supply was fine so we called Teamknowhow and was told this was most likely the water pipe being twisted and that they would send the installation team back to check. A while later the installation team called on the phone and said there was no point in them coming back to us because they knew they’d installed it correctly and that this type of dishwasher broke down quite often, funnily enough it was getting quite late in the afternoon and we suspected they had just wanted to go home. Shortly afterwards the Teamknowhow office called and seemed surprised that the installation team had called us, and even more surprised that they had told us they wouldn’t come out to us and that this type of dishwasher often had problems. They then arranged for an installation team to visit the following morning. When they arrived they were surprised to see it was a built in dishwasher and said they’d only been allotted 15 minutes to sort this out. One of them then put his arm under the dishwasher to feel the pipes and assured me they weren’t twisted and that the dishwasher must be faulty. A visit by an engineer was arranged for the following Wednesday. My wife stayed in all day for the engineer to arrive and within a matter of minutes he told her the water feed pipe WAS twisted and that he had corrected it. The dishwasher has since worked perfectly. TeamKnowhow installers clearly do not know what they are on about, and do not care about the service they give. Indeed one of them complained a lot about Currys. We have made a formal complaint case reference: CC3938917, which has taken weeks to sort out, and is still not resolved. Two weeks ago they said they would get in touch to arrange the refund of the installation fee, but nothing has happened. I’ve just been waiting on the phone to speak to someone but they cut you off if you are waiting in the queue to long (in my case after 6 minutes and then after 15 minutes).Very bad customer care we will never use these people again.",2019-04-11

Rather than replacing it, Currys sent a repair operative from ""cowboy plumbers"" who wanted to cut off the pipe behind the plastic piece and then using tape and jubilee clip to attach it to my undersink waste pipe; I told him where to go. I lost a days salary in order for ""cowboy plumbers"" to suggest a nonesense solution. Ten days after the original delivery, Currys exchanged the washing machine. I complained to Currys and they offered £10 goodwill; obviously I refused.They did not care in the least that I had been badly inconvenienced and had lost a days salary; the two emails I received were very identical template responses.

The man serving us was not interested at all, you got the impression he hated his job and therefore was short and abrupt with my wife and I. After we paid, we were told to wait downstairs for our cooker to be brought out, after a 10 minute wait, another man approached us to tell us the box was missing but not to worry as they had wrapped it in bubble wrap. I told them I didn't want one that had been opened and missing its box etc, but lone behold it was the only one they had left. They told us to go and look for a more expensive cooker (as the £350 one I just bought was mere pennies) which I refused to do and asked to speak to a manger. The managers actual words were it's not our problem now you have bought it, which was met with the direct response of ""give me a full refund or else things will turn sour"", he said no, we will take off the bubble wrap and inspect the cooker as it was pristine and brand new, well you can imagine his face when it had numerous scratches and dents, he had to give me a refund and even to that he was up himself, never made eye contact, never once apologised and only spoke to me to confirm my card number.

218,5caca1f5a843690a54079ced,"I brought a Panasonic blu Ray player online. CUR1961720899 Order number. After having this player for three weeks it did not work probably. 4 times it switched itself off and not all discs would play. I emailed Currys about the issue and that I would like to return. I received a quick response that I could return and to reply to the email about arranging a date for collection. I did this and received another email from someone else stating I would have to return to the store and the blu Ray player will have to be tested before I can receive a refund. I was unhappy with this response, especially as my nearest store is 30 miles away hence buying online. I also paid by PayPal so would be unable to receive a refund instore. I called customer service, the first person I spoke to was unhelpful and when I asked to speak to the manager she refused. I asked for her name and then ended the call by placing me back in the queue. The second person was just as rude and basically implied that I could be lying that it is faulty. I tried to explain consumer law to him but he seem not to understand that I have the right to reject goods if not as described and fit for purpose and as I brought less than 30 days ago I have the right to return for a refund. The onus is not on me to prove that it is faulty if I purchased within the 30 day period. I asked again to speak to a manager but was told I could write in or a manager would call me within 7 days. I found the customer service experience to be very poor and unhelpful. After calling again I managed to speak to a manager Charlene who was very helpful and apologised to be given the wrong information and arranged for collection and refund. It took 2 emails and an hour on the phone to sort this out. I am concerned that a big business like Currys don’t seem to understand the consumer law 2015 and tries to be unhelpful as possible to not follow my basic rights as a customer.

I ordered a small appliance on line through the Curry’s PCWorld website, the problems really started right there and then but I foolishly persevered. The website does not work well with Google Chrome, seriously! I switched to Internet Explorer and I managed to order and pay for the item, all seemed good at this point. The courtesy emails arrived and I opted for the item to be delivered to store as they didn't have it in stock at any of my local stores** another warning**. The email stated a time and date by which the item would be available for collection, guess what? It didn't arrive as stated. I tried to ring customer service and after 35 minutes of waiting I gave up. So I followed the link in the courtesy email to track it on line and that didn't work either, when I finally managed to get it to work by using Internet Explorer they couldn't find my order!! I tried ringing the track it help line and again after 30 minutes and no reply I gave up again. Now this is the 21st century right? Everything is supposed to be streamlined and easier with a focus on customer satisfaction. I can only say that following my experience that this company will end up going the same way as many others before it, heed the warning: Ignore your customers at your own peril! I would still use the store its easier and less stressful but whoever is managing the online side of Curry’s PCWorld and the customer support lines should be sacked, they don’t deserve the jobs they hold.UPDATE: The confirmation for collection has now arrived so I can go and collect my item, hopefully.

Farnborough 2nd visit told was not repairable could refund, but the price had gone up by £50 so not an option, could not order a replacement. Told that Guildford had stock and I would have to go there to swap it out. Went to Guildford told that it was repairable and Farnborough was wrong - was not accepting this, manager called and he allowed a replacement.

I insisted quoting the consumer rights act after asking for the manager they agreed to change the tv but only if I obtain a reference number from Samsung. Although I disagreed with this I wanted the tv changing so phoned Samsung and obtained a reference number then returned to the store. The store then completed the paperwork to replace the tv. We arranged a delivery date and they asked if I would like the installation and demonstration for £45. I thought this would be a good idea to make sure the tv worked correctly when the tv was installed team know how said we only install the tv we don't do demonstrations. I explained that I paid for install and demonstration they said you will have to take up with the store. While this is going on the other delivery person just kept saying to his colleague come let's go. So they left and I started navigating Round the tv the Currys salesman said the tv has got two satellite inputs so you can record on program while watching another this in practice did not work so I phoned Samsung direct and they explained the very limited situations that this possible. So while I don't blame Samsung I have issues with Currys firstly for mis-selling the tv then with them not replacing the tv under my consumer rights and then with paying for demonstration that was not given.

The response from the scam artist I mean salesman was that she needed a cable and produced the Sandstrom 1m cable at £79.99. Seriously?? an £80 cable with a £350 TV? Quite clearly he saw an old person and had pound signs in his eyes. Disgusting.My mother also paid to have it installed. What an absolute joke this was.She has effectively paid good money to have someone open a box and then place the TV on the stand. No attempt made to show her all of the controls, on screen menus etc. Exactly what did she pay for?To cap it all, her DVD player is ancient and DOES NOT HAVE AN HDMI CONNECTOR!! The installer told her that her DVD player was too old and not compatible with her new TV. This is patently rubbish, as there is the possibility of using the composite video connector present on both the old DVD player and new TV.

277,5c9f73c7a843690a301601d0,"If I could rate lower, I would.We ordered a new washer and dryer for my mother. They arrived and were faulty. We advised Curry’s and their shockingly awful “partner” TeamKnowHow within 24hrs. They sent an “engineer” out to check the machines and we were told he would arrange for repair / replacement or removal. The engineer turned out to be a delivery driver who had no clue and couldn’t do anything - he was just to check installation. So he told us to call Team KnowHow again for them to repair / remove the machines. At this point, I had enough and just want them out and gone and my money back. If I bought a mixer and it was faulty, I would just take it back to the shop and get a refund. I can’t carry a washing machine or a tumble dryer, and there they have you.Team Know How (TKH) put me through to Samsung who put me back through to TKH who put me back through to Samsung (yes, 4 people on one call). Samsung took the details and said another company (4th company - Elite Digital Appliance) would send an engineer to check the faults before they could take back the machines and refund. I asked for the phone number for this EDA company in case they didn’t call me and because it’s urgent that I get these machines out so I can get a working machine in. The number Samsung gave me was for a farmer in Shropshire... I am not making this up!The Elite Digital Appliance company called and offered an appointment to fix it for 17 April (the machines were delivered on 25 March). Now, that’s not an option. My mother has had cancer surgery and a stroke in the last few years and as a result we NEED to be able to do washing DAILY. So letting her sit in soiled clothing for 3 weeks or going every day to collect and take washing 1hr away across London to my home for 3 weeks also not an option. It shouldn’t even be a question. Curry’s delivered faulty machines, I want them out and my money back so I can buy working machines.Finally used Twitter to get their attention. After much back and forth, TKH offered to send someone to check installation... I informed them they already did 2 days before and he confirmed the machines were faulty (had they actually read the case / background / my message, they would know this...). After much Twitter activity, TKH finally agreed that 17 April was not an option and to take the machines away and refund. Great. So today is the day. Pick up was due 07:40-11:40, so I left home at 7am taking a taxi to be here by 07:30, but at 12:40 still no show. I then spent over AN HOUR getting passed back and forth between 3 call centre people (not their fault the company they work for a complete failure), to be told the collection is showing as “suspended” and they can’t reach the driver. I sincerely hope nothing bad happened to the delivery team, but selfishly it would have been good to be notified after 6 hours of waiting that no one is going to show. I am then told that they can’t arrange a new pick up or anything until said missing in action driver has returned to a depot somewhere. What?! So not only do “Curry’s” not show to collect a faulty machine, their service team cannot provide a solution / next slot to pick up / any help whatsoever. That’s how bad the lack of service is. I repeat, the machines are FAULTY. After 6hours of waiting and over 1hour on the phone, and not taking no for an answer, I’ve now been told that I have a new appointment for them to collect tomorrow. (I hope). My 77yo mother is stressed beyond belief and I’m trying to keep her from having another stroke thanks to Curry’s completely and utter fail. Next step will be to hire two men and a van to dump the machines in a Curry’s high street store and simply block their entrance until they take them and refund me everything. Don’t order from Curry’s. You don’t deal with Curry’s. There is actually no way of contacting them. Phone calls go through to Team Know How and so do emails and Twitter messages. You get fobbed off with 3 or more other companies playing ping pong with you presumably so they exhaust you into keeping a malfunctioning product. Don’t do it.",2019-03-30

To be fair the girls at the customer service did all they could and it’s certainly not their fault and it’s unfortunate they bear the brunt for the incompetence of the people who should be doing their job properly.

So leaves us with both washing machines.Had to call customer service to arrange for someone to come and install the new one and remove the old one and the following day, someone comes to install the new one but says they don't have the order to remove the other so they leave us with both washing machines again. Called customer service 10min after they leave and they say it's too late for them to come back and collect it even if it had been an error since this was clearly booked and paid for as well.Arranged a third visit for them to finally come to remove the old washing machine for the day after and, after waiting the 4 hours slot (like the previous 2 days), I called and the order appears at 'completed' on their system - obviously my old washing machine is still sitting in the middle of my very small kitchen. The drivers cancelled the order 2 hours before the slot finished without logging any comments or explanations and I never received any notification of this nonsense.Now a fourth appointment has been booked in 5 days time for something that should have been done in one single day, meanwhile this is occupying space I don't have and for a service we paid extra for, and which has taken me several calls to customer service.Could not be more frustrated about the whole service provided.Do not recommend at all.",2019-03-29

The phone calls to them trying to sort out their mess are costing me a fortune too. AVOID AVOID AVOIDUPDATE: The tv eventually arrived. But only after several more lengthy phone calls. Initially they rebooked delivery for saturday after being told that Saturday was not possible and we needed Monday, so I had to make yet another phone call. Then when it did arrive they tried to tell my mum that the recycle service doesn’t include taking away the packaging: There is what it says when you buy (£15) the recycle service “Add recycling and, on delivery, we’ll remove a large kitchen appliance or TV you no longer want. We’ll then take it, along with any packaging from your new purchase, for recycling.” One final thing : I complained about having to pay for all the phone calls to sort out their mess and was offered a £10 voucher. I was told someone would contact me about this- but as yet this hasn’t happened. When I emailed their team about the unfairness of me having to pay for the phone calls they replied that “Unfortunately we aren't able to offer compensation for consequential loss due to a failed service.” The voucher (which is unlikely to cover the full cost of the calls) is apparently just a goodwill gesture",2019-04-03

I then unloaded it and dragged it into the store on my own and dumped it in the foyer! I was then initially told that after all that I couldn't have a refund! When are staff at big companies like Curry's / PC World and TeamKnowHow going to STOP TREATING THEIR CUSTOMERS WITH UTTER CONTEMPT? After spending 40 minutes explaining the catalog of errors and the total frustration of dealing with them they finally gave in and processed the refund.

A replacement couldn't be sorted there and then as the system was still showing the item as being out for delivery so they promised to call me back the next day. Which they did, but only to tell me that the item was now out of stock and I wouldn't be able to get a replacement for 9-10 days.I emailed Customer Support to voice my displeasure and asking them to pick up the damaged dishwasher (now sitting in the middle of my kitchen and taking up room I don't have) only to receive a response saying they were sorry I had problems with my WASHING MACHINE (so clearly not reading the email) and basically saying tough, I had no choice but to wait. I tried a second time, and was told the same thing - tough, just wait and so on. The Twitter feed was no better, saying the exact same thing.

310,5c9877e697afa10aa0fd6d64,"I purchased a Logik fridge freezer from Currys last October. Five months later it has developed an earth fault, which means it trips the electricity supply to the house. It does this about 6 times a day. I contacted Currys on Friday 15th March and within an hour, a local repair company contacted me to arrange a visit - for Monday 18th. The guy came, said it was a ""evaporator"" that had likely failed and he would have to order the part. They would contact me when it arrives to arrange a date to return and fit. On Wednesday 20th, I contacted them, to learn that the part is on ""back order"" - meaning it's not in stock and there's no indication when they will arrive. So I contacted Currys Customer Service department to request a replacement fridge freezer, only to be told that it is policy to wait three weeks before considering a replacement. That's three weeks of having the device trip the electricity - having to reset clocks on cookers and central heating systems. Last weekend, we had a weekend away, I had to take every item out of the fridge freezer and pack my son and daughters fridge freezers with my stock, because the fridge will have tripped and the contents ruined. If an electrical item develops an earth fault and continually trips your electricity supply, you'd disconnect it. And for items which are infrequently used, it's an inconvenience. But for a fridge, that needs to run 24/7 and cannot be isolated, the frustration of having to live with a fault product that is causing so much grief, and have Curry's customer service shrug their shoulders and say ""come back in three weeks"" I find particularly galling. Needless to say, it's highly unlikely I will ever buy another product from Currys and I would suggest you enquire about warranties/guarantees with the salesperson before you do.",2019-03-25
311,5c98033697afa109a49e9e57,I ordered a Swan 70/30 Retro Fridge Freezer that arrived in unsatisfactory condition which the delivery drivers unpacked for me - when the delivery man opened the fridge door the glass shelf was shattered and covered my kitchen floor with glass. There was also a dent on the fridge door (photos taken) I was left to clean up the glass and told a replacement would be arranged and that I would be offered a discount for the inconvenience of waiting so long for the fridge freezer to arrive but also for having to wait in for a delivery and collection.Upon arranging a collection with online customer services Dept I was informed that a discount would not be available so I advised I would be returning the item instead of replacing it and that I would buy a fridge freezer from a different retailer with better customer values. A collection was arranged for 24 March 2019 with a 12.30-4:30 time slot and at 4.30pm I hadn't heard from anyone so I contacted customer services who informed me the drivers were running late. They said the drivers would be in touch. They never showed up. I waited especially for this collection and with two young children I have been very inconvenienced. I am now going to have to contact customer services again to arrange another collection which means another day indoors with my children. This is not acceptable. I need my fridge freezer to be collected ASAP as I need my paypal to be refunded so I can purchase a different fridge freezer from a different retailer!,2019-03-24

318,5c9631cc97afa10bb875a376,"My dishwasher of 14 years broke and I wanted a replacement asap. My priority was getting my old one removed and a new one installed by somebody who knew what they were doing as I had no clue. I looked around and currys seemed to offer the best value. It was £25 for installation of my new dishwasher and £20 for the removal and recycle of my old one (or the other way around). Despite them offering free delivery, I paid an extra £20 for it to be delivered and installed at an earlier date than those being offered for free as I didn't want to wait that long to be up and running again.The delivery guy arrived, looked at my old dishwasher and said that he couldn't remove it because it was integrated. There was no mention of this on the website. I asked why and he said that because it was fitted to the units, it requires a different team to remove it. I pointed out that while it was an integrated machine, it was actually freestanding and not connected to any units and demonstrated this by moving it. He said that it would be fitted somewhere. I informed him once again that it wasn't and was connected by the water pipe, waste pipe and plug just like a freestanding one. Still refused.Then he delivered my 'new' dishwasher and my partner signed for it while I set about disconnecting the old one (despite not having a clue what I was doing). With the old one disconnected and pulled out easily, I turned to the new one. The door was slanted and not flush, it was wet inside, the waste pipe was dirty inside and the plug and wire scraped and dirty. It appeared to have been used. There was no cellophane on the inside of the metal door and was delivered with no packaging. I had originally presumed that his colleague had unpacked it on the van but on inspection, I doubt that it had been packaged.I contacted currys customer services as I now had a dishwasher in the middle.of my kitchen that I couldn't use and hadn't received what I'd paid for (the removal, fitting and recycling). Plus I'd paid £20 extra to have it delivered and fitted earlier not to have a dishwasher stuck in the middle of my kitchen.The customer service was shocking! I had emailed so all the information was there and I'd sent photos of the defects and signs of use. The woman that called me had to be reminded of the issues that I'd raised, provided no explanation as to why I hadn't received what I'd paid for and informed me that I would need to call a separate number to sort out the issues with the product. They are refunding the installation and removal but refused to refund the £20 for earlier delivery. So I've paid £20 to have my family live around a used dishwasher in the kitchen. I have absolutely no faith in them sorting out the dishwasher itself without a lot more inconvenience so am going to connect the dishwasher up and rely on the manufacturer's warranty as I can't use my sink either due to the waste pipe not being connected!Lesson learnt. Avoid currys!",2019-03-23

321,5c96149b97afa10aa0fccde9,"We have just encountered a warranty problem with a Samsung washing machine purchased in 2015 from Currys store in Belmont, Durham. We bought the machine directly from Currys with the so-called 5 year parts and labour warranty. It halts mid-programme and is a major problem to empty and get to the end of any programme. Following many phone calls to Samsung agents reading from the same script we were fobbed off with ""Do you have proof of the registration of the warranty"" despite giving them the reference number and emailing them all the sale documents including receipt. We then went to the Currys store in Belmont Durham that we bought the machine from and waited in a long line of customers complaining about their warranties not being honoured. There were approximately 20 sales people on the floor and 2 persons dealing with the line of unhappy customers with warranty issues. We gave all the documents to the staff person dealing with complaints and he said they would be in touch within 72 hours. On the final day we received a letter claiming that our machine was out of warranty but Currys were offering a £144.99 voucher to spend on a new washing machine in full and final settlement as it was uneconomical to repair. When we rang the number to speak to the senders of the letter it was explained that the only route they could offer was the ""Out of warranty route"" which was a voucher towards the purchase a new one. When I stated that we bought a 5 year parts and labour warranty and wanted it repaired they explained that Currys only cover the first 2 years then the next 3 are supposed to be covered by Samsung. This is a blatant case of mis-selling as none of this was explained at the point of sale and we only bought it because we thought we had 5 years cover. When we explained that the voucher was no good as we would never buy another thing from Currys they offered a direct payment by BACS into our account within a further 72 hours if we accepted it as full and final settlement. So to summarise there are 2 lessons learned here - 1. Currys mis-sell their products with impunity and are not to be trusted so don't buy anything from them and 2. Samsung provide products which do not last as long as advertised and do not honour any ""warranties"" that they allegedly provide and furthermore have pre-prepared scripts for agents to fend off long and many calls from people who have bought these warranties in good faith so don't buy Samsung products period. We paid over the top for the washing machine for peace of mind and have learned a costly lesson but hopefully our bad experience will help other consumers to make the right choice when shopping both in terms of who to buy from and which brands not to touch with a barge pole.

The first time I reported an issue the customer service person booked in the repair people for a day they didn't work. This meant that I was left with a broken fridge over Christmas, waiting in all day for no one to arrive. When they did send someone over they fixed only one of the two issues. This meant we were left with a fridge that would continuously beep about every second for days on end. The longest stint was about a week. It drive me mad and it took three separate repair visits before we were told they would refund us.When we phoned in to sort out the refund,were told we could actually only exchange. To be honest all we cared about is getting a fridge that kept things cold and didn't beep continuously so didn't push it further. We booked in for a different replacement fridge to be delivered, with the customer service person supposedly noting when we were not available. We then get a message from currys saying that they are delivering it on one of our unavailable days. we wait on hold for half an hour for them to tell us thats fine we'll rearrange. This is ignored and they try and deliver the fridge when we are not there. The next time they attempt to exchange the fridge for a working one, the deliver the wrong fridge. We call currys again. They assure us it is resolved. Today a new working replacement fridge was supposed to be delivered. Again they show up with the same wrong fridge. I called up currys and they said that they had sent the wrong fridge to my house, but the right fridge to my old billing address from when I had first bought the fridge. These two places are less than too miles apart. He insisted he couldn't call the driver and get him to deliver to my correct address, but could call and cancel it.

However, once I got home I received a phone call from the Know How team informing me that rather than the fridge freezer arriving tomorrow as paid for, it would now be arriving on Tuesday the 26th. The agent, mentioned that there wasn't enough space in the van to take the broken fridge back on Sunday. I explained that this was totally unacceptable as my 16 month daughter requires milk throughout they day and night and therefore it will be difficult to visit to the supermarket without having a fridge to store the milk/food in. Had I know that the delivery date was going to be Tuesday, I would have bought a small fridge whilst I was still at the store. I had to make at least 2-3 daily trips to the supermarket for the next 3 days. When the delivery experts came on Tuesday - They couldn't take the doors off and demanded that a payment was made to their office before they could take the old fridge and install the new one. They even refused to accept payment via online there and then. Stay tuned - its gets better!!I called the know how team and they assured me that a team would be coming out the next day to sort everything out. Yet somehow, I receive two message quoting two separate times. Next day I get a call from a delivery team informing me they are 30 minutes away and would like to know they need to do - I inform them they need to take the old fridge and install the new one. Why am I not surprised they don't have the new fridge. I call know how team who say that the second team will remove and install the fridge and the agent wants me to call the driver back to confirm this to him...WHY?? I don't work for CURRYS!! Begrudgingly the agent calls the first driver and informs him not to come. So I am waiting for the second delivery team - They have quoted me between 15:00-19:00. Its 19:30 and still nothing - I decide to call Know how and they inform me that the driver has reached the legal driving limit and will not be able to make the delivery. THEY DID NOT EVEN BOTHER TO MAKE A COURTESY CALL OR DROP ME QUICK MESSAGE TO LET ME KNOW!!They finally delivered on 24th - From the 24th - 28th I was storing the food outside. Thank God it was cold!!Now I have raised a complaint with headoffice only to get fobbed off with generic messages for 2 weeks before I decided to CC Alex Baldock the CEO - Only then did I get an email back telling me they really appreciate my feedback. They are trying to palm me away with poor compensation but have not even listened to all the calls to know the frustration and inconvenience they have put me through.

They have not offered me compensation for the hundreds of pounds worth of food I would lose just to check for ice! They told me that this is company policy, but what kind of company request that you to throw out food, instead of having a professional come out and check it? This is a shabby service at its worst and I will never buy anything from Currys again and urge others to avoid them as well. Go to John Lewis instead. They have much better customer services. I look forward to hearing a response from Currys, if you have the guts. If you do, try giving me a comprehensive response without mentioning “Company Policy”.",2019-03-21

Has i had purchased these items a good while back and had kept this kettle in store-age until i needed to use it. I never dreamed that there would be any issues with it, however i only used this kettle a few times when it stopped switching on. I also have foolishly lost the receipt and therefore believe that i would be unable to get a replacement or ask for refund.",2019-03-21
341,5c93a27c97afa10bb874b0d8,"On 07 November 2018 I made an online purchase on Currys.co.uk of a Vodafone 6GB SIM card, product number 096519. A couple of days later a product was delivered but an incorrect one – a 2GB Vodafone SIM card (with the receipt having the same 096519 product code as on the Web site).I immediately called TeamKnowHow (which is Currys’ customer service), explained the problem, we discussed at lengths how to make sure that the correct 6GB replacement is delivered and arranged a return. Currys received returned item on 15 November, processed it around 21 November and sent a replacement which I received on 23 Nov. The replacement was again 2GB Vodafone SIM card and not what I ordered.Then this process repeated 3 (three!!!) times and every time I received the same identical SIM labelled 2GB. I spoke to TeamKnowHow 12 times (on 07, 13, 15, 17, 20, 23, 27 Nov, 04 and 21 Dec) and sent a formal complaint Email to them on 04 Dec. I received no response.During my conversation with TeamKnowHow on 21 Dec I agreed to use the (deficient) 2GB SIM card and was promised a £10 voucher as a compensation for the enormous amount of distress and wasted time I was put through by Currys. This voucher arrived by snail mail on 10 Jan 2019 but it appeared to be only redeemable in a store. Unfortunately, this is useless to me as I do all my shopping online and there are no Currys/PCWorld stores nearby!A bigger problem is that when I tried to use the SIM card (the third 2GB replacement) it reported zero credit. So I contacted Vodafone on 10 Jan 2019 and they said that the SIM was sold with NO DATA bundled with it. Apparently, Currys should have but did not “place the bundle properly” onto the Vodafone SIM card they sold.I sent an official complaint to Currys' headquarters via snail mail on 11 Jan 2019 and received no response. When I called TeamKnowHow on 05 Feb they said I will have a response in a week or so. A month later, on 13 March (and, predictably, having no response) I called again, arranged for an item return and now waiting for a refund. Oh, and they also told me that they do not respond to customer complaints! (Which I can confirm - they ignored both of mine.)In short - you are lucky if your Currys product works but if it does not - you are screwed because TeamKnowHow is useless, Currys does not have a process to effectively resolve customer's problems and is ignoring complaints.",2019-03-21
342,5c939c1c97afa10bb874ac05,"Completely disgusted by your lack of customer service. I provided an uplift number at least 2 weeks ago to be told that the replacement item I want is out of stock. I requested an email informing when it will be back in stock but as I had received no response from you at all, I have rung in today to be told it would be in stock on the 3rd/4th april. I was then pushed from pillar to post to 3 different departments, the last of which defied belief. The female who spoke to me was rude, abrupt and exceedingly unhelpful. I want an immediate refund on my item, I want the faulty item which is still sitting in my kitchen removed and I will be copying this email to every available social media outlet that I can. You should be thoroughly ashamed of yourselves for this appalling service. As said before, we have waited a long time to have a new kitchen and one of these American style fridge freezers to go in it. We have now been without a fridge for over 3 weeks. You have completely spoiled the experience of a new kitchen for me and I will be advising anyone who is thinking about purchasing anything at all from you to think twice.

343,5c93851097afa10a78502e2f,"Dreadful Customer Experience: My uncle ordered a fridge / freezer to be delivered on Sunday 10th March 2019. He received a text from Curry's the day before stating they would deliver between 4pm - 7pm on the Sunday so he cleared his old fridge / freezer ready the delivery of the new one and tried to keep the food that was in the fridge cold until the new fridge/freezer was delivered. 7.45pm on the Sunday and still no sight of the fridge/freezer or a call to say they were running late. They did not turn up and did not even decency to to call him and tell him they were not coming. I called Currys the next day on his behalf and their words were ""the driver run out of time"" which is totally unacceptable as he had waited in all day and all of his food was ruined. Currys finally booked another delivery slot a week later and he had another long day waiting for the fridge/freezer to arrive with no apology - the fridge / freezer finally turned up but was one of the last deliveries on the list. Curry's could have at least made sure that it arrived early second time round. I called them again today and they have offered him a goodwill gesture of £26.24 which I feel is an insult for all the food which has been wasted and his time waiting in. unacceptable - Shame on you Curry's - you will not be getting our custom again.Update: 26/03/19 - Finally get a response from Curry's with just an apology. No regard for the food wasted and the time my uncle spend waiting in for 2 full days and for the wasted time contacting them to try to solve - They have finally paid him a pitiful £26.24. We will never order from Curry's again and if would urge people to think again when ordering from them and to order from John Lewis or somewhere else to save the unwanted problems.",2019-03-26
344,5c937aa697afa105441c57f9,"The issue that I have experienced was: I bought 3 items from currys on the 10 February 2019. I received one on the 11th of Feb. and the other two on the 15th of Feb. I sent an email to currys on the 3rd of March stating that I was having a problem with the washer, it has stopped during the cycle twice. I told them this is a new washing machine and I would like my money back. At this moment this is being done by email. they emailed me telling me that an engineer had to come out to check the machine to see the fault then I will be able to get a refund if I do not want an exchange. I emailed back saying I want a refund not an exchange. I had to contact the manufacturer of the washing machine to get the engineer. When the engineer came out he said his computer is not reading the board in the washing machine and because it is a new machine, I should be able to get my refund which I told him I needed. I called currys immediately as the engineer left in the morning, this was the 8th of March. I told them my situation and told them that I do not want an exchange I wanted a full refund for this product. I was told that will be ok, it will not be a problem. They arranged for the washing machine to be picked up on the 9th of March, they sent me an email the night before stating that my exchange item will be delivered as well on that day. I sent back a message saying I had specifically asked for a refund which I was told will be done when I returned the washing machine I have in my possession. they returned an email saying I should tell the people who are delivering the item. On the 9th the item was picked up and the new one that they brought was refused by me because I told them on numerous occasions I wanted a refund. I have since been calling and every time up until yesterday I am being told that the necessary paper work was not done but the person I was speaking to is sorting it at the very moment and I should expect my refund within 3 to 5 working days. I made numerous calls and sent numerous emails and I am getting no where with currys. And to make matters worst in the same order I had bought a 55"" JVC television and yesterday I was dusting it I saw where the screen is coming away from the base that holds it. I called them about it and they said someone will call me to arrange when they will pick it up and replace it with a new one as this Is also a new product, that was yesterday, 20 March, I have yet to receive a call about that. I told them that I recently moved house from where I bought the items therefore the television needs to be picked up at my new address. This is just too much for me. I have spent too much money with currys to be treated like this. I have spent over £700 in this order.",2019-03-21

Currys kept saying that either Swan haven’t sent the kettle, or Hermes hadn’t delivered it and they would have to check up on this before they could do anything.I pointed out that my contract of sale was with Currys, not Swan or Hermes. I was told not to get angry. After having the same conversation for 5 weeks, yes, I was angry. I wanted my money back.I then turned to an online Complaints system, Resolver. After detailng my complaint they sent emails to Currys which were, surprise surprise, answered. That’s where the good news ends, because Currys reply was - guess what, they would have to contact Swan and Hermes.There have now been 11 emails from Currys, eventually saying I would be refunded within 3-5 days.I left it for a week before contacting again to ask where my refund was, the response - sorry, it will be with you in 3-5 days.I asked how many 3-5 days they wanted before giving me my money back.The tetchy response? Your refund will be with you in 7-10 days.

349,5c92451897afa10aa0fb6329,"Ref #: 742921681 My sister's washing machine was due to be delivered a week today. She called after the given delivery time had expired to check where it was and was given the assurance that it would be delivered. It wasn't. She called the next day and was told that Currys couldn't deliver until Saturday afternoon. Currys agreed to install the washing machine for free due to the errors. Currys turned up on Friday when she was not home with the machine, despite claiming they couldn't deliver before Saturday. It was then rescheduled for Sunday and when it arrived, the engineer did not install the washing machine as agreed. Curry turned up today to install the washing machine and the machine is faulty and damaged. I called Currys to get the machine changed, but was told that it had to go through Samsung. After not being able to connect with Currys, I was asked to contact them myself using their live webchat, which I did. I was then told by Samsung that I needed to get Currys to contact them. Once Currys contacted them whilst I was on hold, I was told that Samsung would not provide an uplift number until one of their engineers come out and inspect the product. My sister has called Currys and asked to speak to a senior manager and has been treated disrepectfully by customer service who has tried to make out that Currys have no mangers available and using stalling tactics to avoid putting her through to a manager. She's now waiting for a manager to get back to her by 3pm today. Why is it that customers are the ones that are expected to suffer due to the incompetence of Currys? We are expected to be take time off work to accommodate Currys, who fail to do what they say they are going to do. Why does she have a brand new faulty machine that Currys have left in her house and now Currys, Samsung and their third party repairer are all quoting different internal processes they have to follow at the expense of the customer who purchased the product and does not have a working product. She wants the faulty product removed from this house and her money back which she is entitled to so she can purchase a working product from a competent company. Currys you can take the product back and have the debate with Samsung over what to do with the faulty product. It is unacceptable that you expect your customers to be inconvenienced and go back and forth to yourself, Sunsamg and their third party repairer.",2019-03-20
350,5c9240c597afa10aa0fb6088,"Working in customer services myself, I held off writing a review to give Currys the chance to respond and sort out the problems I have had. After 4 visits, ignored emails and general lack of communication I have to say how bad my experience was. Cooker fitted, oven not working properly, 2nd visit to confirm it was faulty, 3rd visit to deliver the replacement (they would not fit this one due to safety issues that even the fitter said the initial fitter was renowned for ignoring) 4th visit (after I addressed the safety issues) and they said that the original wasn’t even faulty and indicated more issues that no one on the other 3 visits did! He agreed to fit but insisted it was exactly the same as original and neither was faulty. Between all these visits at weekends, that took up my free time, there were several emails and phonecalls from me and my landlady which were not very helpful and made it very difficult to resolve anything. I have resigned myself now that the cooker is just not great quality as I could not bear any further visits or time spent on this. After all this, I did send a detailed email to Currys which was ignored and when I chased it there was no apology, nothing....just another phone number to call. Will never buy from Curry’s again. It was just too much hassle, so aggravating, and more than disappointing. Their customer service is almost none existent. The 2 star rating is only because the fitters were very pleasant on every occasion. Shame they are let down by the company behind them.",2019-03-20
351,5c9212a697afa1073ceb8ac3,"The summary of the story is, Currys have issued me with a refund and sent out a gift card of the item value (around £250). Even though i've informed their customer service agent on the phone that I have changed my address since making that purchase they have sent the item to my old address anyway! The gift card got redeemed by someone else and now Currys won't give me my money back despite it being entirely their fault - lack of attention to detail and appropriate security measures.Since 22nd February I've been dealing with their gift card team, who are by the way very slow to respond and take about 5 days each time.Today they have sent me this:I have received a response from the team, confirming that after investigation, the original Gift Card issued has been redeemed. As such, we are unable to issue a replacement.This is absolutely shocking and by far the worst experience I've had with any retailer to date. This is definitely a violation of consumer rights.

I really was not happy, I had taken an unpaid day off work to get a delivery that did not show up.

359,5c8fe80197afa10318016803,"I dont know where to start with this but here it goes. Initially I didn't want to write this review because including everything they did wrong will be too long to read but apologies in advance for people taking there time out to read this review. I also didnt want to waste any more time with currys but the public have a right to know how I was treated as a paying customer.I called up Currys customer service line about the second week of January and said I'm interest in a particular American Style Fridge Freezer (LG GSL961PZBV) and I also work in Oxford Street. Do you know what time it closes and does it have the one I want on show. The agent comes back says yes we do have that particular product at our Oxford Street branch and if you order today you will get it in about 2 weeks and store closes at 8.30pm. I said thanks and was abit dubious about the delivery times because on there website it said 10-21 days.I finish work at 7.30pm thinking I got plenty of time so I got a bite to eat as it only down the road. Long story short I came to the store at roughly 8pm and as I approached to come in a representative of currys says its closing now. I said dont you close at 8.30? no we close at 8 but as I mention the product I want as Im guessing it was a high ticket item he became very interested and wanted to help. At this point he mentions there no fridge freezers at our store but you can pay for it here if you want. As frustrated as I was I continued with the order but as the guy was putting through the order he did it like it was an online transaction. I said if thats how you do things in the shop I could of done this at home because what he was doing was identical to the online website. Then his manager says actually thats not how its done and get told off from his manager but it was too late and he puts it through as an online transaction.At this point 2 weeks pass and call customer services and query wheres my fridge? There response was where waiting on stock and when we do, we will send you a text message of the date of delivery. Two weeks pass I get a text, delivery is scheduled for Monday but no time slot. Its sunday now and still no time slot so I called them to tell them I have no time slot? There response was you will receive a text about 10pm today with a time slot. I said please then I can notify work if its a half day or full day of work since its unpaid.Its Monday still no time slot so I took a whole day off work. I called them again saying why didn't you send me a text message with the time slot? Agent apologies and says we had problems with our systems but your delivery is scheduled for 2-6. I was so annoyed and explained due to your mistake I could of worked half a day but you cost me a whole day without pay. His response showed no empathy or compassion and offered no good will gesture so I just hung up.Day of the delivery they arrive at 7pm mind you I could of worked as normal and they were late but I didn't want to spike my stress levels and complain. Also to let you know I paid for recycling and installation upon delivery. The lorry pulls up and I asked if he could remove the packaging so I can see the condition of the product. As he removed the packaging it was so badly damaged to the point bits and pieces were hanging out. Driver agreed that we had to reschedule delivery for another date. Driver called currys to tell them the product was so badly damaged and also asked if there was another in stock so that he could deliver it for another day but just my luck no stock available.I called currys again to try to re arrange another date but they said we have to wait for the driver to get back to the warehouse to log it on his system that it was damaged. I replied back saying but you just spoke to the driver and I also have proof of pictures but they were not having it. I had to wait a few days for the driver to update his systems. Three days pass called currys again has your systems been updated? There reply was yes so we continued to trying to reschedule another date but informed me next delivery is in 4 weeks. I then explain that the driver told me that you are due stock this week but the agent informs me that they have been already allocated to people. At this point I was about to explode, I explain dont you think a mistake like this should be prioritised to me as I have been waiting longer than those customers who have just recently purchased? You would think this would make perfect sense as if you can explain to your customers that you had problems with previous delivery's and it might take longer to receive there fridge to unforeseen circumstances I am sure they will understand. That fact you communicate with the customer shows good customer service skills but currys dont bother with anything There reply was its out of my hands and I guess you would have to wait until we send you a text message with a date. What I am getting with currys it that under no circumstances do they want to help the customer even though its there fault.All this is going on I did not receive any compensation and not even help to try to sort this out quickly. Three weeks pass I look at there website and it showing that the fridge I ordered can be delivered for next day delivery but I found it odd why I wasn't notified because I am still waiting on stock. So I called them again and queried why do you have my fridge available for next day delivery for a new customer if I am still waiting on mine? They put me on hold of 10mins to query this and there reply was this seems to be a mistake as we dont have stock available and he advised me that if I was to go through that process you would only get a email saying no stock available. Did they change it on there website? of course not, they let customers order thinking they were going to get next delivery.I am lost for words at this point because how does a company as big as currys treat customers with a lack of respect. I was tempted to get a refund but knowing how long they take to do anything I bet that would take another month of two. So I stuck with it and received text message for saturday's delivery. Perfect since I am off and also got a early time slot of 9-1pm. The issue I am having here is wasting food again because I defrosedt the fridge last time and all sorts of problems happened that day. Anyways day of the delivery they show up and took off the packaging and it looks good. Also the fridge fits through my door so installation was not required but I didn't want to call them back as they are useless.Let this be a lesson for anyone who tries to order from currys. Stay well clear from them because they do not care about the consumer. Just look at me you would of thought paying 1,500 for a fridge including insurance, installation and recycling would of mean currys valued your business but no, they want to make it as difficult they can for the customer. Let it be known that if something goes wrong which is highly likely then good luck I say. To those who have been patient enough to read this you have been warned.

She treated me las if I was not intelligent when i asked her to explain the unreconciled difference and asked for an invoice. She tried to explain the extra products she was selling me by speaking so fast and when I told her I didnt understand and didnt want to pay for extra services she just repeated it even faster, I felt bullied into buying a service I dont want . The laptop was left with the store to set up and they wanted my apple id to be written on theri systems, i refused as its a privacy issue and then had to write it on a piece of paper which i asked the technician to destroy but they left it on top of the product in full view of everyone when i picked it up. The set up was supposed to take a day and when i didnt hear from the store after 2 days I tried to contact them by phone but there is no number and the main customer service number was appalling, They told me they couldnt contact the sotre and I would ahve to just drive there to see if the item was ready. A day later having still ehard nothing I called the customer service number again and was told the same thing, When i asked to escalate the matter to a manager I was told there are no managers there, which is a lie, and the operator was extremely rude to me and repeated that I wooudl jsut have to drive there to see if it was ready. I asked to raise a complaint and was put on hold for 15 minutes then cut off .",2019-03-18

So many times told to get an uplift number from Bosch for replacement as per engineer who visited's instructions and yet Bosch said they need to deal with them direct. Then Bosch said, hang on, we've told them its transport damage, they don't need an uplift number as it is their fault.Currys are still - 4 weeks later - ignoring the content of the email chain and saying, you guessed it, 'contact Bosch for an uplift number'.Hello?!!?! I've said they won't give me one. They've said to you they won't give you one. It is your problem.

Waited in all Sunday for this cooker and it didn't arrive. Called customer service which was closed. Today I call customer service and was told it had been scheduled in for next Sunday. So they want us to wait a week with no cooker. After telling us it would be delivered yesterday. So angry and the unprofessionalism of this company. Told by a girl from customer service 'well I suggest you just go into the store and get your money back' what a fabulous way to keep customers happy and solve the problem. If the sales advisors were not too busy trying to force sell you insurance and broadband then they might be able to communicate factual information. Instead we were bombarded with insurance policies, broadband deals, offers and promotions. I told the advisor I have worked two weeks of nights I don't need this I just want to pay for this cooker. Instead he continued and actually pleaded with us to take out insurance. Appalling and not the responsible thing to do! So here we are, no closer, no cooker, and now they want us to take a 30 minute drive to the store to go through all this again. I have never come across such an unprofessional company in my life. I go on the website and there are the cookers advertised and SAME DAY DELIVERY if you order before 6pm! I do not have time to be dealing with this. I'm outraged and would not recommend this shambles of a company to anyone! I wish we had read the reviews before I even stepped foot in that place.",2019-03-18

See last paragraphTwo weeks ago I bought a Neff oven with installation and collection online.This was to occur on Friday two days ago and after taking one of my few days off per year to receive it, I was rung by the delivery driver to say it was on the wrong lorry and nobody was qualified to install it. (I wasn't the only customer on that delivery round with the same problem.) I took delivery noting the product was still wrapped and had not been inspected - I note from previous complaints that defects are often blamed on customers post delivery.I immediately rang customer services and the earliest I can rebook is two weeks time on the 29th but I was at least guaranteed the morning. I rejected the 26th because I'm booked at work.I also fired off a complaint.I just now got the response which was really only Janine,(although it had the word apologise), stating just what Currys legal position was and confirming that they would be there on the 26th (the day I rejected) and if they didn't make it then they'd only pay only less than half what Curry's would normally charge for someone else to put it in and take it away. No sympathy for me losing two days holiday or the inconvenience, a total lack of feeling.Certainly no explanation.Seems its yet another big company that does what it wants to people with no real regret or financial consequence. Hopefully there will come a time when they are treated like flight or train operators regarding compensation.I'm already reviewing how to use the small claims court.Just to update when I finally got someone sensible to talk to this got sorted and the team that came second time were fully trained. prompt, polite and went the extra mile.

This went on for a good 30-40 minutes!! As soon as the fridge was in they drove off!I told the delivery men that the lads yesterday were going to take the doors off to get it into the kitchen only to be told that they would have damaged the fridge themselves so that they didn’t have to do this! How disgusting!! Spoke to an advisor on the phone who was just as unhelpful (however I do understand the manner as if worked in customer service myself and I know how it is having people complain to you all day. still not helpful in the slightest!) I was told that I’d have to leave the fridge out in the rain and have someone to take the doors off and complete the delivery tomorrow, while the delivery guys sat outside my house! I wouldn’t usually leave such a review however I was disgusted with the attitude of today’s delivery men and for them to make such accusations about the lads who attempted delivery yesterday was so disappointing. Can I just make a point also that at no time during our order that was placed in store were we asked about access into the property, the door into our kitchen is a normal sized PVC door with large gated access to the side of the property onto our drive. There was no restrictions once the fridge was through the door. When making orders from here make sure you ask about delivery terms as this nothing was discussed with us.

This did not happen. I rang this morning at 9am to ask when they are likely to arrive to be told the delivery would be with me in around an hour and half. Two hours later I rang and they said they had one more delivery then it would be my turn, around 12.30. They arrived at 12.45pm. It appears that they still do not value their customers as I was left to the end of the 4 hour time slot. I would have thought they would have the decency to make sure I didn’t have to wait that long to get my paid-for goods. In total, I have waited on your delivery men for ten hours.

Second delivery the guys couldn’t swap the door around. Had to have a Currys technical person out. Third visit, they swapped the door but left it without the interior light working and the display flashing. Fourth visit, an Electrolux engineer straightaway determines that the the Curry’s person has mucked up the door sensor - so it is now chargeable, which I Refused to pay. Yet another call to “Customer Services” who tell me I have to arrange to get it repaired and pay for it then claim it back - no other way to get it repaired.

Now to my dismay it is no longer....I purchased a fridge freezer on 22 Oct 2018Customer ref 7421380491 which included removal and installation of the appliance.The delivery was as usual, prompt and installation was excellent.It gets worst.....At the end of February the fridge stopped working properly, food purchased one day would be ""off"" the following morning.I contacted Currys on 5th March and they immediately arranged for an engineer to visit on 7th March.This visit Job No C4977552 was inconclusive. The engineer could not do a basic repair as it was more complicated and he did not have all the equipment needed. He said the cold air was not circulating upwards and he believed there to be a leak.On 7th March I telephoned currys customer services to complain that a fridge under 6 months should not have a fundamental problem and it should be replaced. They refused and stated I needed another visit to carry out the repair with an alternative engineer. The date given was Tuesday 12th March. Job no C4981635Today Tuesday 12th, I have had a call, cancelling the visit as there has been a miscommunication between currys and the engineer team for Friday 15th March.This is extremely POOR and UNPROFESSIONAL SERVICE FROM A LARGE COMPANY. TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE as the fridge has now not be operating properly for over 12 days and two days off work with a 3rd day impending is disgraceful.....It gets worst....At 1.00pm I have just had a call returned from Louise from Customer Services, who was looking into this Case number cc3932619The Engineers have denied visiting the property to see the fridge freezer on 7th of March. C4977552 Claiming that I had cancelled the visit...The first engineer that came on the morning of 7th March could not fix the machine and said an alternative company would need to visit.I had 4 calls on the 7th March in the afternoon from the engineers on the numbers 01217666222 trying to arrange a new visit. They were unaware that a previous engineer had seen the fridge. I explained that I was not happy that it could not be fixed first time and these must be the alternative engineers. My response was that I needed to get in touch with Currys customer services, to see if the machine could be replaced.After a long debate over Currys "" rights to repair an appliance of over 28 days"" I agreed to have a repair carried out.A new job number was given C4981635 as according to their records I refused the second engineers visit and this was for 12th March 2019. They cancelled this today....Louise of customer services said "" Unfortunately there is nothing we can do until the visit is carried out on 15th March and I will call you on Monday 18th to keep you updated........I asked for an explanation as to why today's was cancelled and she could not give an answer!!!!THIS IS A FARCE.........",2019-03-12

Ordered over £1500 worth of items in December and explained to the store advisor I was buying a house but needed the products delivered to my brothers which was 2 minutes away from the new place, they advised this will not be an issue as there was a long time frame for delivery etc. Items arrived on 08.02.19 and finally moved into new place 09.03.19 we opened the TV and say that it was dfam,aged, screen had a massive crack through it and small cracks and the bottom corners. I phoned an advisor who advised he will speak to his manager as it is outside of the warranty period. Was then told would not be able fix it or replace it as I had moved the television andyway he was going to get a manager to call me back, to my surprise I got a call back but the manager clearly thought he owned the business was completely dismissive and rude as soon as he got on the phone. He had made the decision not replace the TV as it was 2 days out the warranty and had been move. After an argument and refusing to give me any contact numbers or names to contact someone else higher up I said do I really need to email head office / CEO to get this resolved he basically said do what you want. So I did and awaiting a reply. He did not care about the amount of money spent in store and the amount spent the same day prior to seeing this smashed TV. This would cost the company nothing to be repaired but to be told you will have to pay for it and that is that! oh and it can cost FROM £100+ for repair. I appreciate the Policies however it was 2 days out of the warranty, clearly I am an honest person as I could have said that I never moved it, if he had given me any opportunity he could have seen (or someone instore) that it was clearly damaged in Transit and that is was brand new literally just taken out the box to put in the front room. The way I was spoken to was terrible and that fact he told me nothing will be done he has made the decision and that ios final, there is always someone else to go speak too but he would not have it,no customer satisfaction, nor a resolution that won't be me out of pocket. I look forward to the reply from the CEO / CEO's PA to get this resolved. No happy at all, I have never had problems with Currys and the majority of my electricals are from there and where we have moved had more to get but I now question this ,due to 1 bad egg in the company not willing to come to any arrangement at all.",2019-03-11

When the driver and his colleague arrived, he said it was too heavy to bring upstairs to the first floor, he was only allowed to take it 20 steps, not upstairs. I then spoke to customer services Team Know How and said my builder could help him carry it as I was not at home. No, they would not allow this. So I told them to take it back so that I could order from someone else who would actually deliver as promised.I phoned the driver to confirm he had taken it back, but he tells me it was sucessfully delivered after all and hung up. When I arrived at the flat later that day, I found that he had unpacked the fridge freezer and left it standing on the PAVEMENT in the MIDDLE OF THE STREET! No delivery note, no signature!My husband and I had to carry it upstairs (we are in our late fifties/sixties)and I damaged my back badly. I wrote to Customer services and lodged a complaint. Explained the entire situation and asked why no delivery note was left and why it was left in the street. The automated response says I should hear back within 3 working days. 3 weeks later I email and phone Team Know How (which I have dubbed Team Knnow Nothing) and get a ridiculous response from Alexander. First of all he is surprised they hadn't responed by now, but made no apology. Secondly when I ask to speak to a supervisor he says I can't, because it's their job to sort out any problems.

Kind regards, Damian Beck Team knowhow ----- Original Message ----- Dear Sir/Madam I ordered a freestanding Bosch fridge freezer online, which was delivered today: order number: CUR1960616968, delivery reference: 7428327878. When your driver phoned in advance, I told him the the entrance to the flat was on the first floor, and there was another internal staircase up to the kitchen. When he arrived he said he would not deliver the fridge upstairs because it was “too heavy”, and he was only allowed to take it 20 steps. My painter was upstairs and offered to help your men bring it up, but he still refused. Your ""Team Know How"" called me and I explained that as your website did not ask for delivery instructions, and that if he wouldn't deliver it upstairs, then I wanted a refund for the appliance and for them to take it away, so I could re-order from another supplier. I asked the lady for a call back in 5 minutes when we knew what was happening, but she never called me back. Instead, your delivery men left the appliance on the pavement in front of my building (not even in the hallway!), removed the packaging, and drove off without even leaving a delivery note nor asking for a signature. I find this behaviour completely unbelievable, and this level of service from Currys utterly unacceptable. The whole point of booking a delivery is to have the item delivered, not left in the street! My husband and I (in my sixties) were able to take it up to the kitchen when he got home from work, however I put my back out very badly in the process. I cannot believe your delivery men were unable to do this job themselves. I expect some form of financial compensation for this awful customer service, including the stress and physical pain it has put me through, and I will certainly give Currys a bad review.

413,5c852f5b97afa10a783d5d0a,"We purchased a DeLonghi ECAM 23 4 coffee maker 10 months ago from the Currys in Fareham.Initially we were very happy. However, when the descale warning came up we followed the instructions implicitly and the process seemed to work - we could not clear the warning message. We contacted DeLonghi support who after suggesting we follow the instructions which we explained we had. They then said they would look at the machine but we would be without it for up to 21 days.As it clearly has a defect, and it was still under warranty, I took it back to the Fareham store from which we bought it. They said that they would send it to DeLonghi - I pointed out that is was defective but they stated that as it was more than six months old It had to be sent back as the warranty was with DeLonghi not them. I pointed out it was defective but they stated I could not have a replacement as I had not taken out the additional insurance. I pointed out that I bought it from them not DeLonghi and therefore they should honour the warranty - but they were clear it was DeLonghi's issue not theirs. They were also not in a position to offer me a temporary replacement and told me I would just have to not have coffee for three weeks.V disappointed with the response and my question is - If they state that the warranty is with DeLonghi and it has to go back there for repair - what do I need Currys for? Next time I will just buy online direct from the manufacturer.",2019-03-10
414,5c852d2497afa10b24b849bf,"I’m very disappointed with This company. I needed a MacBook Pro and went to buy it, my dad was always a fan of Currys so we decided to buy from this company.We wanted to pay monthly so we asked for a finance plan which seemed very helpful. We were at the desk and about to pay the deposit, it was just after your closing time too so we weren’t sure if the payment will go through. We used my mums card to pay but entered my dads details as it may have been due to the rush. It had declined the card and said we are not ‘ eliagable ‘ for this plan, which didn’t make sense as we had enough money to buy the MacBook right there and then, we just felt like finance seemed like a better option. We had gotten a letter which told us to call a specific number to find out exactly why this happened. We went back the next day to eliminate factors such as closing hours and details of the card. This time round we have entered the correct card details and arrived earlier then last time. Same scenario we were at the desk trying to go through the process and the same comes out ‘not eliagable’. We asked why this is happening- no one from the staff was able to tell us why they were guessing and had no idea what was going on. Ideas which came up were maybe the system thought it was fraud and that my dad must have taken a big loan. This was very unacceptable! My dad had known for certain no loans have been taken by him. How can a system think there has been fraud? Well they have explained that beforehand we had used my mums card but had given my dads details. Yet we outlined now that the details of the card holder which was my dad matched the card which was being used to pay the deposit. Back to square one ... we got a letter and had been told to call the number which was a company in charge of financial checking.We sadly went home very confused with what we have heard and decided to call the number. After a while we get through to them and the women says she has no idea why this has happened and that I must ask the store. I was going round in circles trying to find the answer as to why Currys will not let me do finance for the MacBook. In short points : Currys says to ask the finance company and the finance company to ask Currys. Finally, they have come up with a solution after a very long process to send my dads statement etc as to why this is the case. I was relieved! Finally an answer - we wanted this to be sent by post and they have informed us it will take up to 7 working days. It’s been 2/3 weeks and we haven’t heard anything yet ! So just we decided to go elsewhere and buy it there ! The staff were really lovely and were shocked as to what had happened previosulsy. I can honestly say that it was such a big fuss with Currys and they have lost a good trusted customer, not to mention my family won’t be going there again. Happy with my MacBook Pro and do not recommend going Currys pc world, especially if you would like finance - you’re just better off going somewhere else.(Also we had visited our bank and they have confirmed no loans have been taken by my dad and this should not be happening)",2019-03-10

After approx 15 mins no sign of the machine so went back to the department only to be told it wasn't in stock by a young lad from the back of the store, who then told me you'll just have to pick another one or get a refund. Chose to have a refund, needles to say i will now have to wait 5 day's for the money to be back in my account. Made a complaint to a young girl at the refund counter who was very nice and she went to speak to the Manager who never bothered to come and speak to us just passed a message saying they would speak to the person concerned. Very poor customer service.",2019-03-10

I found a laptop I liked but was told it was out of stock so said I would go to the Deepdale store which was not a problem. When I left, I decided instead to order one online and pick it up from the Blackpool store today. Once again, staff were rude and unhelpful. They tried charging me £60 for Office 365 even though I kept telling the guy that it says online it is included with that laptop. He kept making up some stuff about it being a trial and it wasn't included to the point where it was patronizing. When I was setting up the laptop I rang Currys customer service helpline who were very helpful and told me straight away that once I open the laptop and open Office it will ask me to activate it which gives me a years free subscription. It's a good job I told the guy in store to forget it or I would have paid an extra £60 for nothing!!",2019-03-09

422,5c82fb2297afa10a783cd048,"I ordered a fridge freezer and washing machine to be delivered on the day I moved house. The delivery was scheduled between 1 and 5 and when it didn't turn up I phoned 4 times to be told it was on its way. I eventually had to go to the store at 7.30 at night, exhausted from moving and was told it was being delivered two days later. The assistant was not at all sympathetic and although he offered me the delivery and fitting charge back, he could do nothing about the food that had to be thrown away. I was without anything for two days, my daughter had to take time off work to stay in for the delivery as I was looking after grandchildren and I had to pay to eat out as I could not even make a cup of tea. I spoke to customer services who said they could only pay out for freezer food and then it depended on the size of the freezer and offered me £31 which went nowhere near the cost of the food I lost. My son-in-law took it up and managed to get me £45 but that still does not cover my expenses and the unsympathetic treatment that I have had. I will never shop in Currys again and recommend that anyone should avoid purchasing from them.",2019-03-08

That's were the positivity ends.Arranged and paid for next day delivery, fitting and product insurance.Machine arrives as promised, two boys delivered it, then claimed they couldn't fit the machine as they couldn't turn the water off at the stopcock!! Suggested i get an independent plumber to come and fix so called faulty stop cock and they would come back out to fit machine. This is after they flooded under my sink and left it in that messI took the Monday off work and had a plumber out who told me that there is nothing wrong with stopcock but its just residual water coming out after stopcock is turned off and any fitter would know this.Contacted Curry’s customer services who told me to go into store as they couldn’t get anyone out to try and fit this again. They also advised as far as they were concerned the job was completed and closed! Went to store and greeted with unhelpful staff who again couldn’t get a fitter out and told me to write a letter of complaint. Asked for a refund which i can’t get until they pick up the machine which is still sitting in my living room waiting to be picked up.I am disgusted at the initial ineptitude of the fitters who were clearly not experienced in fitting a washing machine and that all machines come with a valve which prevents leakage upon fitting.For a company with such a high profile and claims of a great experience for customers, I have now spent a week with no washing machine, a wet kitchen and still no money back.If this is your idea of a positive customer experience then I seriously suggest you need to review your processes. I will never set foot in your shops again given that your poorly trained staff and general disinterest for your client base was so glaringly obvious.",2019-03-08

So please do not order online as you can get scammed by their website, and insulted badly by customer services.As they also never inform you over delivery as it is, dont play russian roulette.As an extra it has been confirmed by the company.on twitter because I wasnt phoning them again to be insulted, when as a customer do you get insults. And where the hell does the website change the postcode, you have to generate the address via postcode.... so its my fault, but to be told you need the postcode the website changed it to - how can you, you put in the postcode and house number so you check the address, book delivery, go to payment, you wouldnt get my daughters address with the postcode the website changed to.... but hey ho on twitter it was confirmed 10 minutes ago they will not even bother redelivering it to the correct address, nor refund the money, as I dont know this other postcode, so I am off to.my solictor, cannot get it refunded by bank as it was unfortunately a debit card, money was taken earlier in week and currys refuse to refund the money still.

I explained that I didn't see anywhere on the online form to state I had stairs and that I would suggest the ""special delivery instructions"" part online was made more noticeable, but he went on and on and made a big deal of it saying some places won't deliver if up any stairs-surely that's discrimination of people living in flats! 3 times I explained I didn't see it on the form, had I done, I would have stated and he STILL went on about it, talking about health and safety! I said look what more can I say, I've been here 16 years and never once had a problem before (and I'm on my fourth washer!).

The pair turned up, took one look at my oven and then asked what sort of oven I was getting (hardwired). They then announced that they could only do gas installs and refused to install the new hob with the excuse that ""fitting the new oven might damage it"".Called customer service (who sounded like he was in the middle of dinner) then said I could wait another week and then they would send someone out to fit the hob next week - fitting the oven would be a couple of days later. I have to take another 2 days off work to sit in all day for another fitter to tell me he can't install it as fitting the new oven could damage the gas install.Don't buy anything from them unless you can walk out the door with it.",2019-03-04

To cut a very long story short, I have spoken to so many people within Currys and have to explain the whole story each time!! Each time, nothing is done about it. I have escalated it on Martin Lewis's Revolver site. A member of staff agreed I had been mis-sold and would get a refund, they then backtracked on this and refused! They tried to say I had to ring Kenwood customer service, which was actually their number!! I am currently exploring my next option, which is likely to be court but I will not give up until I receive a refund! I have seen other customers comments online who have ordered the same cooker and received a refund after complaining.Do not touch these bandits, they cannot deliver anything that resembles customer service. Wish I had seen the thousands of negative reviews on here before parting with my hard earned money! Give it to a company that respects their customers.Currys, do no task me to get back in touch with you AGAIN - I will only speak to you now, to arrange a refund and collection of the cooker!Do not buy Kenwood CK405G Gas Range!",2019-03-04

I phoned TeamKnowHow and spoke to a rude lady who was eating her lunch: she told me to take it back to the store. I took the item back and asked to speak to a manager as a refund couldn't be given. The manager marched the sales assistant who sold me the product towards me and completely embarrassed the pair of us by making us argue it out in the store. The problem became very heated and the Manager actually asked the sales assistant if he had lied to me - completely unprofessional! The Manager, who was extremely blunt, told me to go home and come back in an hour to speak with a different manager. I followed his instructions and when I returned I was met with the other Manager. He gave me a refund on the miss sold item and, as the computer was found cheaper elsewhere, he said he would take £50 off (also for the trouble I had gone through). He said he had applied the discount to the card I had paid with and I went home (by this time with a very sore head). Upon checking the receipt, yes, he had taken £50 off the computer BUT... he had ADDED £60 in miscellaneous products!!!

Conveniently ,the refund apparently went in on 12th Feb! because they wait 28 days for a customer to collect the item - which was the 7th Jan.

Following this I received an email stating my order MAY be cancelled due to a pricing error. Baring in mind the sale was already FINAL currys then further went on to refuse to send out the TV based on an error they had made despite the sale already having been final. When speaking with a manager at currys I got far from anywhere in explaining their legal duty bound to honour the contract of the sales reciept and so the ""manager"" stated she would get back to me after discussing with the legal team and 2 weeks later almost I've heard nothing! This is a legal issue of which huge company's like currys get to put pauses on such mistakes to maximise their profits whilst a genuine customer like myself, who let's not forget was only shopping for a TV because the one I bought from there originally was faulty has to suffer the consequences and be out of pocket.

Was told at first that they would not price match as it wasn't within 7 days. I said it hadn't been delivered yet so how can 7 days apply. The person on the phone was then quite rude and patronising. I asked to speak to a Manager but was refused. He then said he would ask a Manager. After about 10 seconds on hold (seemed incredibly quick) I was told they would reluctantly refund the £80. I told him I didn't understand the problem and if it was easier I would cancel the order and place a new order at a lower price. He kept saying I wouldn't be able to do this but could offer no explanation as to why. Remember, delivery was still two weeks away. He then said well it doesn't matter because we're matching the price and the refund will show up in 3 to 4 days. Well that was over a week ago and guess what... Nothing.I suspect there was no conversation with a Manager and he said whatever it took to get me off the phone.

488,5c798c1f97afa10ad4bf6e41,Shocking experience. I wouldn’t even give one star but that’s the minimum.Failed delivery to my mid 80’s mother in law of a TV we bought for her online.She waited in 7 hours initially for a delivery that never showed. Not once did Currys/ Team Know How ring us to advise. When I rang the customer service number and eventually got through to the agent they couldn’t wait to get off the phone because it was by then 8 o’clock and she wanted to go home. The agent bad mouthed me to her line manager thinking I couldn’t hear and then the line manager refused to speak to me (so much for Manager support Richard - you should be ashamed). They then booked me a new delivery at a time I had explicitly said I didn’t want the item (seriously who wants an all day Saturday slot?!). I asked for a call back at 9am by a manager - I got it at 5pm. This is aside from my mother in law missing a dinner engagement that evening and my wife and I missing the cinema as we sat on the phone. The second delivery today was also delivered four and a quarter hours late - again with no proactive contact from Currys/ Team ‘Know How’. When I complained I was offered £40 as a gesture of good will. That’s £2.63 per hour we’ve waited - nice to see they place a high value on our time. Jade the customer service manager thought this was fair. Really ? This is quite aside from the c. 2.5 hours we’ve additionally spent on the phone to them at our expense (heaven knows what that will cost !) and aside from the stress and inconvenience caused and sheer rudeness of their staff. I’m also going to have to waste another hour or so of my time putting this in writing to their customer services complaint email address this weekend. If this was regulated business they’d be bust. Customer service shocking. Delivery shocking. Whole customer ethos nowhere to be seen.Team ‘know How’ about what exactly ?Currys should be ashamed of their whole approach to the customer.,2019-03-01
489,5c796ce897afa10ad4bf5a40,"We purchased a TV from your shambles of a company in June last year which was a TV to go in our little girls bedroom who is 2 years old. After the TV developed a fault with the sound we took it back to the store on the Saturday 16th Feb. Whilst there I clearly explained that the fault was intermittent and did not happen every time. The TV was then sent away and arrived back at the store on the following Sunday. Upon testing it fault occurred again straight away. Apparently, this had been through a QA procedure which we can only imagine consisted of turning it on once despite us making very clear that the fault did not happen every time.As such we then went back to the store on Monday 25th and explained our disappointment that it quite clearly had not been fixed or checked properly. I was then told that it would have to be sent away again to which I explained we are heavily reliant on this TV as my wife is nearly 36 weeks pregnant now and this TV enables her to put on my daughters favourite program in the morning so my wife can have a quick shower and get herself ready for the day and that while I was happy for it to be sent away for repair that we would need a replacement TV while this was happening.The store advised this was not possible but that due to the nature of the fault they could order a replacement which would take 5 working days. Again, I reiterated that was too long and explained that it was not our fault that the repair was not done properly in the first place. We were then advised that as an alternative the store could put the refund onto a gift card so that we could order the TV ourselves so that it would arrive the next day, which seems ridiculous when it takes the store 5 days to order it, but the issue would have finally been resolved so this is what was agreed.The replacement TV should then have arrived at the Bluewater store on the Tuesday 26th but having not received any confirmation by the 28th I emailed customer services regarding its whereabouts. Customer services then responded saying that we would have wait 7 – 14 days while they conducted an investigation which is simply laughable. Any company with any decency would have ordered another one and apologised for the inconvenience. However, for us to then explain the urgency via email regarding my wife and get the exact same 'stock' reply back word for word from your staff shows the utter disregard that you show for your customers. I have now been into store three times to try and resolve this, I have written a vast amount of frustrated emails and made numerous phone calls and still after two weeks my daughter is without her TV. This is simply not good enough and when discussing this in the office today I was amazed how many people turned around and said never buy anything from Currys. If only I had known this myself.Finally the last straw today, despite saying that we would never purchase another item from Currys, we received an email stating that a gift card for the amount paid will be posted to us. A gift card is not acceptable and furthermore does not cover the inconvenience and time spent trying to get this resolved due to your inept customer service staff.Please resolve this matter urgently.",2019-03-01

498,5c77135697afa10630ae2f42,So so so disappointed by the service I have received from curry’s. After waiting over a week for delivery of a washing machine was rather disappointed when started to remove the packaging to find the top of the machine badly damaged. Immediately contacted curry’s who were very apologetic. We were then told that the machine we had purchased was out of stock and would be at least another week. Obviously not too happy about having to wait but that’s not the big issue. The issue I have is that I now have a washing machine in my front room (which is not particularly big ) that curry’s will not remove till the new machine is delivered!!! After numerous phone calls and emails that are just returned with a standard reply I am completely flabbergasted that this company feel that it is acceptable for a customer to have a damaged washing machine plonked in the middle of their front room with 2 young children in the house. I explained the danger it is causing as it’s a massive obstruction but they just don’t care! I will never ever purchase from this company again the worst customer service I have ever received!!!,2019-02-27

Just before the end of the 4 hour slot they turned up, checked the kitchen for water/waste/fitting and went out to the van to find they didn't have the bloody Washing Machine! The driver apologised and assured us that they would deliver it the next day, at an agreed time and we would be 'compensated'. Late that evening we got a message allocating another 4 hour slot for the next day - we tried to call but they had closed for the day. We waited in the following day and they turned up late - almost an hour after the 4 hour time slot. When we complained Currys refunded the delivery cost and, after a further week, sent us a £20 Currys voucher for instore use only. This does not compensate for the inconvenience caused by the utter incompetence of this company. They do not deserve to be in business!!!The response from Currys is completely missing the point. It wasn't just the initial delivery date that was the problem - we took two days off because of their incompetence and they were late on the day it was actually delivered.

504,5c769fa497afa10db0a7c64e,"last year i brought a samsung Q7F Tv (2017 model) after only a couple of weeks this turned put to be faulty, i was given a replacement tv this was also faulty and also according to staff a refurbished tv, which i was under the distinct impression stores are not allowed to do. i then traded up to a LG Oled TV this also turned put to be faulty, so so far 3 faulty tvs from currys. NO goodwill gestures have been forthcoming for the last 2 tvs. I have had to spend even more money and upgraded further to a Sony oled tv so far seems to be ok. No help towards the costs was offered. ON top of this i ordered in store a new zanussi cooker, this had to be ordered on the website in store as their system was not allowing free delivery. The cooker turned up when they stated it would the delivery guys did not stay to unpack the cooker. I started to unpack the cooker myself and discovered major damage to the hob, The damage looks old so i suspect it happened at their polish manufacturing plant !. I quickly contacted customer services whos first thought was to offer me 10% to keep the cooker, the damage to the hob meant i would not be able to use and left the underneath exposed which is a health and safety issue ( i have a 3 yr old daughter who is classed as disabled). They then agreed that it could be exchanged, i was put through to Zanussi who then stated that it was curry's who should be contacting them. I have since spoken to them again and a replacement is due on the 1st of march. which mean i have fresh food that is now no good as it will be outside its eat by date. Also again no mention of goodwill gesture. This is not Curry's finest hour with this poor level of customer service and poor quality products, i can see why when i have been instore the returns area is busier than the cash til. I am now totally fed up of this situation i was nervous enough about getting a 4th tv from curry's, if this goes wrong i will not be shopping at curry;s again.",2019-02-27

Ive speak to currys about requesting a new one but they pass the book to hotpoint and then hotpoint pass the book back. I finally manage to put a request in for them to decline it and say the washing machine as been fixed. They said they would ring me to say if it as been declined. I got no phone and had to ring back up 2 weeks later. Currys said it got declined cos the machine as been fixed. I had to phone up again cos the machine was leaking. I had to wait nearly two weeks cos the part was out of stock. The customer service is shocking. I really would definitly tell people NOT to go for the after care plan if they say that you can request a new one. They wont replace it just keep on repairing it. Shocking service,2019-02-27

I was told that they could cancel the order and I place the order again, but I’d have to wait for the money to be refunded and cleared back to me before doing so. They couldn’t do anything about it because it was a system error. They eventually sent me through an E voucher so that I could reorder the missing item, without them having to refund me or cancel. And I managed to get the same delivery date for both items.Which brings me onto the delivery, why give a 1pm - 5pm time slot when they don’t have the logistics to honor this?

514,5c756d3497afa1060450ff7a,"When will I learn?? Wrote a review 02/02/2019 after a failed delivery and then ensuing saga to get my item. Ordered an item last night at 19:45 for delivery to store this time (scheduled for today) ...guess what, not turned up but SHOULD be there tomorrow. The frustrating part is that the sales person in store was unable to tell me anything other than that it had been shipped, yet a phone call to KnowHow was able to inform me that there had been a 'resource issue' (eg. DPD were unable to collect). Both parties should have the same information.In addition, if the Web states delivery for store the next day, then it's perfectly reasonable to expect that should be achieved and logistics are in place to cater. Ordered an item from Amazon this morning and it gets delivered today - wow, that's how it should be.Sorry Currys, whilst this particular incident (thus far) is not on the scale of my previous, you really do need to start getting your act together. It really has come down to 'never again' for me I believe.********* UPDATE 27/02/2019 *********...and so the saga continues (you couldn't make this one up!!). I call to check progress of delivery for today and the order has been lost. Not only, once again, do Currys have my money and I have no product, but they will not issue a replacement or refund until an investigation is undertaken. The same old rubbish as my previous dealings, despite the fact that it is clear, and was the previous time, that the item has never made its way out to me; it has been lost by either Currys or DPD. The investigation should purely be for internal purposes; it should not impact on the customer. The law is clear - a delivery date was agreed, it was not met (another chance was even given!) and I am entitled to either an immediate refund or my product. How on earth does this company keep trading - it is negligence on an unbelievable scale. Not once, but twice for different items at different times. If it wasn't so time consuming and serious, it would class as a comedy script.Currys, you are totally inept. I am just one customer but, by the general ratings on this site, it is clear that I am far from alone. Every single one of these complaints should be forced under the nose of your customer service director who is, quite clearly, not performing his / her function. It's simple - get me my item today or issue a refund. Please, please, please demonstrate to me that somewhere there is capable of fulfilling a simple task.",2019-02-27

519,5c75200797afa107f8870551,"This morning I have been reading a very long list of grievances unfortunate customers have had when trying to deal with this company. I'm beginning to think that my particular issue means I'm, so far, very fortunate.I purchased an item off the website on Sunday afternoon which 'stated' next day delivery to a store of my choosing after 5pm. I have used this website in the past & although I got no email confirming the item was in the store I called the store and was told that the item was there so when I had received no email yesterday afternoon I didn't actually think too much of it as the other time the item was in store I just wasn't informed.Yesterday however was a different story, the store, whilst being the nearest to our home is 14 miles away so an hour round trip needed. As you may have guessed, the item was not in the store. When I complained to the shop attendant I was told it's not our 'fault' DPD hasn't delivered yet (this being 6:30pm) I then asked to speak to the manager who stood in front of me, (not sure he actually listened as his face was completely blank) then just said well it does say you will receive an email when the item is at the store. I explained that this isn't always the case and that I purchased the item as a next day delivery and so had every right to expect a next day delivery. He then said well, what do you want me to do? I responded that what I would like is to have the item delivered to my home now at no extra cost (haha!) to which he declined to respond. I then said that due to the responses I had at the store I would now be cancelling the item to buy from a more reliable and ethical supplier. He then went on to tell me that I would have to wait until the item had been received in the store so that they could then process the refund. This morning I read on the website that ""Cancelling an online or phone order CANNOT be processed in store""So once again a prime example of the misinformation given by this company.I have also learned of the excessively long times people have had to wait for refunds to be processed and the number of times customers have had to contact about refunds, some still waiting after a month so it seems once they have your money then basically, they do whatever they like!",2019-02-26

When it came to it, the delivery men refused to take the old one saying that it was ""too heavy"" (which is a lie). I showed them that they could but they weren't interested and continued to argue with me about it. So I ended up taking it down the stairs by myself causing me discomfort. With two people it would have been fine. They proceeded to just stare rather than help me.They then made up something about it not fitting on their van. They delivered the new one then left the old one in my front garden. I was told I would get a text and it would be collected tomorrow (25th Feb) but I haven't received a text or anything.Dreadful service. Won't be using them again.",2019-02-25

Phoned up to make a complaint (for one to be lied to!) and also why put so many deliveries on when they've got to watch the hours as someone at the end of the line will be let down won't they!!On phone got complaint ref and told manager had authorised an early Monday delivery between 7-11 am was told to ring and check next day. Done so had to go through whole story again! They spoke to manager, also both had said no lorry had broken down and said they shouldn't of said that and been honest! was assured it would be a 7-11 delivery.Saturday got text to say Del would be mon 1.30-5.30!!!Phoned on Sunday again had to tell whole story again, he also went to manager!! Was told they can't physically put anything in the system or see Del slot? But he'd emailed dispatch to contact him regarding delivery, said I would get a text Sunday night confirming Del which I didn't!!!Still on system for afternoon Del (i won't be here) was told regarding lorry breakdown and out of hours delivery time were both true it could happen he broke down which made him run out of hours 😂😂😂Said I've already had two of your people say that no truck had broken down so don't you lie to me and make matters worse!! In anger told him to cancel order and refund to be told u had to go back to store to do it (altho I paid £15 on the phone to have item taken away (where do u get that refunded from?) all in all an awful experience plus my complaint was not escalated, had no email confirmation as promised complaint!) overall terrible service!!

It took me 45 minutes and repeating myself approximately 20 times to get a refund, that according to my receipt I was well within my rights to. Where I apparently went wrong was mentioning that I originally bought the product in their Brentford store and that I was advised that I could return the product opened within 7 days if it was faulty. The manager (Roger) then became fixated upon that and said that I would have to go to Brentford if this was something I had agreed them. This is complete bullsh** as their receipt clearly states you have 30 days to return a product to any store of theirs. I also made the mistake of starting off by saying I didn’t want the product as it has a clicking noise, and not specifically saying “it’s faulty, I’d like a refund”. He just couldn’t seem to connect for the first 45 minutes that I didn’t like the product because it was faulty. Overall it’s among the worst customer service I’ve received. Most of the time my words just bounced off him and he looked increasingly smug as I became more frustrated. Just grateful I eventually got my refund and now know not to use Currys again.",2019-02-23

They said they would repair it, but then wrote it off as they couldn't fix it. They said they would send a new tv,ok we thought. Well it came but no box with the tv and the delivery driver said your repair tv is here,could not believe it when we were given a recon tv,it came with the documents showing the repairs it had done to it.we told them we wanted a new tv and after making so many calls to chase everything they said they would send a voucher for us to go to currys to get a new one. Great we thought,when the voucher came it was only 850. Our care plan said like for like up to the maximum price.So now we are out of pocket for all the time and phone calls we have made during this stressful time and 500+ we've lost for the price of the tv.We tried to get back more so we could get a better tv but they said no. Even the staff said they have done this to other customers and when they went back to Teamknowhow they have give them back a bit more.We need a tv so we went up tonight as we've been without one since Christmas week,its now nearly the end of Feb. Only to find out from staff that the tv they said we could have for 850.00 is in fact NOT the equivalent,its one down from that.The equivalent was in fact another 150.00. The staff could not believe we had been treated like this or why they didn't offer like for like.So we have had to pay another 150.00 for the equivalent one that we had. We had to get a sony as we brought all the Sony sound bar system at the same time to with the tv.We have had to buy a new tv stand as they makes legs now for the tv stand and not just a base,So all on all we have been well put out of pocket and the staff responsible for sorting out a replacement have been a nightmare and do not care.We brought a expensive tv in good faith and a Sony one thinking it would last and we lost out.So be careful when buying items from currys as when it breaks down through no fault of your own they will give you back as little as possible,so where's the point in after care plans.

I dont believe that the lorry broke down, and seeing as their depot is a mere 30 minutes from where I live, it could SURELY be delievered either tonight or first thing tomorrow.

So they loaded it back onto the lorry and left.....but this goes to show I was LIED TO, as there obviously IS a delivery driver in my area today. Why do Currys lie to their customers to get them off the phone? This is disgusting treatment. I live in the next town to their distribution centre so why couldn't they have delivered? and WHY tell me their was no drivers when there clearly is? Am I in some way a less valuable customer than those that was getting their orders delivered today? As a 'gesture of goodwill', they have offered me £20..... which is only half of what I lost by taking the afternoon off for nothing. The thing that has made me the most angry is that the delivery driver told me that the last person he delivered to, was shocked that his washing machine was being delivered today, as he had booked a Tuesday delivery slot, So Currys can deliver to him 3 days early, but can't deliver to me when they are a day late, and LIE to me constantly!

I was told my money was ring fenced and was in limbo.I was told I had to go to the bank to get my money back and he would have to cancel my order and then I was promised delivery for tomorrow as I have no fridge etc.So I go to the bank and they confirmed that currys had in fact received the money and that there was NO issues on my side.So I phoned currys and spoke to not so helpful staff member... who couldn't seem to understand the reason for my discruntlement. He confirmed that I had made payment but as the order was cancelled (by them) I had to reorder it! He couldn't understand that because they had my money I would find it difficult to make the payment... yet he kept reminding me that I would get a refund in 3 to 5 days... I explained on several occasions that I had just moved into a house and i have no fridge and i have children too.I asked him for his help to resolve this due to the fact it was clearly their fault. I came up against a brick wall and unwillingness to help. He against said I needed to buy the product again (with what?) And get it delivered.. though he couldn't not guarantee delivery tomorrow as planned! He even said that delivery even if paid for are NOT guaranteed ever! That one is beyond me.In the end I said that I wanted to make a complaint and he said he would take the complaint and it would be processed. I said what will happen in regards to the complaint and he said it would go into the system and that would be it and the member of staff will be dealt with. I asked if I would be contacted and he said no, why would I be? As he had spoken to me. The conversation continued and he asked what I wanted from the complaint. I said that I would like this to be resolved so I got my fridge tomorrow and an apology. He said he had apologised and said an official one and that it's easy for him to apologise. He said if I knew him I would realise it isn't easy for him to say sorry. His attitude was terrible.I will openly admit I was fuming at this point. The bank staff was listening and was amazed by the lack of help from currys. She even said she wont shop there again. In the end he agreed that if I repurchased the item he will refund 10% and I will be a free delivery and a £20 gift card.

I reported a final fault on 13th December 2018 and Currys fobbed me off with an inferior repair company called WRA , who booked the repair for 20th December . ""Engineer"" arrived on foot , few tools and no spare parts so how he thought he could repair it is beyond me , and eventually said he would order parts but that I would not get it repaired until after Christmas , after he left I was fuming and rang Currys , another 2 hours of my life I won't get back , and they agreed I could have a replacement and would send me a voucher code , which they did , but when I went instore to choose a new cooker I discovered that the voucher was worth £150 less than the original price of the cooker . The sales assistant tried to convince me that the voucher was offered for a cooker of similar specs but I pointed out that the suggested cooker was not similar , having smaller ovens , manual ignition rather than automatic , and manual cleaning rather than catalytic linings .

We did receive a refund for the extra items after going into a different branch to ask if this was correct to be told NO. I made a complaint as I am furious about this, not to mention its ILLEGAL to do this. in which I was replied to then ignored for almost 2 weeks to be told a simple sorry and that I wont be receiving any feed back on my complaint as this will be dealt with internally.

Contacted Team know How Support (many times) who explained that they would attempt a repair and would send a local engineer. Stated that not entitled to a refund as outside of 30 day policy. Engineer attended and found that water pump was not working and would need to order a new pump with NO known date as all were out of stock. I checked on line reviews and found that other customers had encountered the same problem and that one lady had THREE replacements before the matter was sorted. (perhaps this is the reason that all the water pumps are out of stock!)I am now in the situation where I have to wait until 8th March for the part. (believe it when I see it). I have just seen another review on Trust Pilot a few days ago about the same fridge who had a replacement door. It seems that the fridge is no longer made.

After doing this I was told I would receive a call in the next 24 hours to arrange a date for the exchange, again heard nothing.

There were staff stationed in other areas but refused to help.The item wasn't in stock according to the uninterested till operater. I found it not surprising that he didn't try to sell another vacuum cleaner to us. In that time the wife managed to find out the same from a staff member.

Its slow even tho its brand new.. and when I went to write a review on it on the currys website it is clear that they have made it impossible so just seems to me that this company sells dodgy goods, with dodgy reviews and when I last went to a store to look around all I saw was the employees standing around, hands in their pockets and they had no employees in the carphone warehouse part so I couldn't buy the mobile I was interested in. Just terrible to be honest. STRONGLY ADVISE YOU DO NOT SHOP HERE. Although I did buy an all in one printer, seems great so far and was really cheap, controlled by my phone so pretty cool but other than that don't shop here for anything but printers..

This company does not deserve customers money,Avoid buying from this company at all costs, they dont care about anything except selling warranty's i just wish i had taken numerous peoples advice NOT to buy anything from Currys. i learned the New Malden Branch.I purchased fridge freezer made a delivery date with know how team.. waited at home for delivery that didnt turn up.. I called the store who confirmed nothing was scheduled, made another date which I had to take time off work for. When I removed packaging I discovered alliance was damaged.I called the store to report this.and advised I would have to plug it in as I had food that came out of broken appliance. I was told this was ok. Person in store told me to call hotpoint.. I refused as my contract was with currys.i said I don't want to speak with hotpoint.. I expect currys to sort issue. Only to be called next day by hotpoint. Who insulted me by offering £30.00 To keep damaged appliance.and was also told as I had installed the appliance there was nothing they could do... I refused to accept that reply. As I had advised currys rep that I needed to use the appliance.I was given a number and had to prompt hotpoint to ask what the number was. I was eventually told to give number to Currys to allow a new order.I visited currys store at New Malden.spoke to.manager explained rudeness and lack of service with hotpoint which made me decide they didn't deserve my custom.. I agreed to purchase another appliance £80.00 more expensive. And ask they contribute £40.00 And i pay £40.00. Manager refused and put me on the phone to customer service... I use the word lightly as that is not what I received, I was offered and insulting £20.00. And after much discussion with an u helpful rep. I decided not only did hotpoint deserve my money.. Currys didnt deserve it either. So.i asked for a refund.. that's when the fun really started, for almost 2 hours I was messed around, to the point where i was advised i may get a parking ticket if i overstayed my time. I am a disabled lady who was not offered a seat. Nor a drink of water, I was in chronic pain as I had passed my time to take my meds. The guy i was dealing with Ruben was made to look ridiculous as he was being told conflicting information, which he passed on to me, I actually felt quite sorry for him one of the managers kept popping over .. then disappearing, he did NOT have the good manners to step in to try and resolve the matter, he could see I was both irritated.frustrated,and getting nowhere. Yet he done nothing.The only positive thing in all this was the guy Ruben, who ""tried to help"" and My Son who use to work for Currys leaving and getting a job where he was not being harassed to sell warrantys on a zero hours contract.

They did offer repair but expect my family to go without a tv for 6 - 7 days (After paying £700 for a tv I expect it to work more than 2 months). This is inconvenienced us as loyal customers and it is appalling the way we have been treated. Incase we was wrong we contacted trading standards and they said ""they should have replaced the tv and also they don't have to provide a tv while yours is gone UNLESS it takes more than 7 days"", judging by previous reviews I think it will take longer than 7 days.

581,5c6bf60097afa10574390940,"I bought a Microsoft Surface Book 2 from Currys/PCworld towards the end of February 2018. Within the first month I experienced problems with it and these continued and worsened throughout 2018 until I was forced to stop using it; the screen would not detach (or take a few attempts after minutes), my battery life was almost nonexistent and the charger was very temperamental - the slightest touch and it would stop charging; the final straw with this was it taking me 4 different mains sockets around my house for it to actually charge. I have experienced 'BSoD', or 'Blue Screen of Death' multiple times for no apparent reason at all, and finally I bought this for use with my design job however whenever I would load any Adobe programs like Photoshop, Illustrator etc. the Surface Book 2 would become incredibly slow and the fans sounded like a jet engine preparing for take off. Now you may be wondering why I did not return it within the first month? I have explained this to at least 10 different staff members at Currys/PC World, from customer services to management staff; on March 3rd 2018 I suffered a suspected TIA (a mini stroke) - This lead to me being hospitalised and having multiple trips to hospital over a 3 month period for scans and tests etc. And on June 25th 2018 I was admitted to hospital with a potentially fatal heart infection called ‘Infective Endocarditis’, I had a very intense course of IV Antibiotics over 1 month in which I was admitted permanently to hospital, I very nearly needed emergency open-heart surgery as I came very close to Dying. Once discharged at the end of July I was bed-bound for a further 6 weeks while continuing a course of harsh antibiotics. It has taken 8 months and I am just now getting towards the end of my physical recovery from this.(The reason I came extremely close to dying from this infection, and why it has taken so long for me to recover, is because I have had a heart condition since birth called Critical Aortic Stenosis and have had 4 Open-Heart Surgeries which were spread out from the age of 6 weeks old, along with 2 keyhole surgeries in which an artificial valve was placed within the pulmonary valve of my heart - as it is artificial (titanium stent with a material valve inside), it has no way of fighting bacteria and the Infective Endocarditis had started to attack this valve).As you can probably imagine, returning a faulty laptop had been the least of my worries for most of last year, plus the fact I was literally physically incapable of returning this laptop to you. As I have stated countless times; I can also provide absolute proof of my hospitalisation and all of my health issues stated above, should you need it. I have been in contact with at least 10 different members of staff, I have worked with Resolver who taught me about certain laws in which I am protected such as; The Sales of Goods Act 1979 along with the Consumer Rights Act 2015. Despite knowing these laws, and how I am within my rights to receive an entirely different laptop of my choice, plus knowing of my reasons for not returning within the first 28 days of purchase due to Valid Health Reasons, You, as a company have refused to cooperate - I have received the same 1 sentence replies from almost every member of staff from customer service all the way to management of ‘I must get a repair as it is outside of the 28 day return period’.. I have even complied with this and sent my Surface Book 2 to be repaired at the Microsoft Repair Centre in Germany and they have sent me back the exact same laptop and have stated that they have not serviced it due to a mismatch in serial numbers - I gave them the exact serial number that was on the original packaging which You, Currys/PC World, gave me when I first purchased the Surface Book 2 from you.I would also like to add that when I explained my reasoning to a particular ‘senior’ member of staff named Yasmin whom customer services redirected me to, she became very aggressive and refused to listen to a word I was saying, she said and I quote “I understand, but I still don’t see why you couldn’t do anything” when I explained to her that I almost died from this heart infection. When I asked to speak to a manager she said “You don’t need to speak to a manager, I am a senior member of staff”. From the moment I was redirected to her she was open about her refusal to help me and even denied any knowledge of my previous contact with Currys/PC World.I am well and truly disgusted by Currys/PC World. I have stopped all payments to Creation until you resolve this issue. I have stated what I would like to happen many times in my contact with yourselves, I hope it has been noted in my complaint reference as I was told it would be.My PC World Complaint Reference is: CC3844010My Resolver Case Reference is: RES6145308I am going to continue posting this to your social media as well.

Dear Sir/Madam I am writing this email to you to express my complete and utter dissatisfaction over the level of service offered by yourselves in regards of the above order and that as of today the 17th of February you have still failed to deliver a full and proper service that was expected by us in relation to placing this order with you.We originally placed an order with you on the 15th of September 2018 for delivery on the 27th of September 2018 at a non specified time meaning that one of us had to take a day off work to wait for this delivery, your team arrived on the 27th and refused to deliver the item despite us briefing you of the circumstances at our property. We then arranged for you to deliver on the 29th of September a Saturday again at a non specified time we waited in all day no contact and no delivery was made by you to us. We went to the local store where we placed the order on Sunday 30th of September and after much discussion and argument arranged delivery for the 1st of October the fridge freezer turned up as planned with no delivery issues because the delivery chaps you sent that day where not work shy and prepared to do the job. we were advised to leave the fridge off for a number of hours until the oils had settled in the motor which we did, the following day we noticed the fridge door showing a number of faults in the paint finish.We returned to the store on the 2nd of October to point out the failure speaking to member of staff called Adam, we returned to the store on the 10th of October after failing to hear any updates regards our complaint made on the 2nd of October. A replacement door was arranged for delivery on the 12th of November the door and the fitter arrived as planned on the 12th but when the door was taken out of packaging that was clearly opened before the replacement door was found to be heavily dented and damaged. it then took you until the 12th of February to sort out a replacement we had to arrange for our daughter to be at the house you failed to show up at the house stating that no one was at the property. Eventually you turned up on the 16th of February with a replacement door the door was fitted but this door has turned out not to be a like for like replacement in that the inner door linings where different, and so we now have a situation where the acrylic pockets don’t fit as as they should. Also to top the level of service off i was told by the the door fitter that it was my responsibility to dispose of the door that had been removed as this was ( Company Policy) even though this was never briefed into us . i went into the local store that the model of Fridge we had ordered in the first place KENWOOD KSBNDIX18 was no longer available and that was why we had received a different door. At no time where we advised of this during this process. In total we have had to spend some 4 days numerous trips back to our local store at Cribbs Causeway to try and remotely get what we first ordered, when i asked for my money back on 16th of February i was told that you would want the goods back first please tell me what are we supposed to do with our fresh and frozen foods in the meantime and why would i want a replacement fridge from you? who would want to through the same process as the first delivery.

586,5c6bbd6697afa10bb84fa02f,"In December 2018 I purchased a few items from currys in Bury Greater Manchester. A dyson hoover, washing machine, a 50inch Toshiba and a 65 inch Toshiba. Everything was delivered on time as expected. I had to wait for my tv brackets and then my electrician Daz to come fit my brackets and TVs to the wall. He came last Wednesday. He fitted the 50 inch Toshiba. No issues in that regard. He fitted the bracket for the 65 inch Toshiba and then waited for me to arrive to assist him with lifting it and putting it on the wall bracket. As we opened the box first we noticed the remote not in any packaging with batteries inside just resting on top. That was a little suspicious so I got the phone out and made a video. We removed the top layer of polystyrene and below was the tv. Not in no packaging at all. The protective cover was shoved into the box. Then we took out the other bits. The stand. Again in opened packaging. Everything was already opened as if to suggest it’s all been used already. I DID NOT BUY A USED ITEM. I PAID FOR A BRAND NEW ITEM. So I decided to contact currys. The rep at TEAM KNOW HOW basically first blamed it on Toshiba and tried to get me to direct my concerns towards them. I said no that is something they should do. It’s not my headache. Then he said that particular item was delivered from store so I should go back to the bury store. I went back to store. Reported matter to the manager. She promised swift action and a call back on Friday. No call back received. So i returned to store on Saturday and seen another manager. He spent 10 mins to enquire and then concluded that there is nothing they can do about it. The item was not from there store. It was from the warehouse. DISSATISFIED AND DISAPPOINTED I LEFT THE STORE. TO BE HONEST I WAS QUITE SURPRISED AT THE APPROACH TAKEN. I BELIEVED I WAS DEALING WITH A REPUTABLE NATIONAL BRAND. WORS OF WARNING. DONT USE THIS COMPANY. IF BY MISTAKE YOU DO THEN OPEN THE ITEMS STRAIGHT AWAY AND MAKE A VIDEO OF THE SAME. NEXT STEPS. See if someone has the decency to respond to this review and resolve my issue.

They didn't have the decency to text or call to let me know, I just sat there all day waiting for delivery and it cost me a day off work too, I informed the person I was talking to that I wanted to cancel the order and would like the money back in my account the next day, so I could order from another company, he informed me it would take 5 days, which is strange as it only took one day for the money to be taken from my account when I ordered the dishwasher.When I went back to my PC it was still showing the page which showed the status of delivery, this had been changed to ""contact is needed"" with the message saying they had tried to deliver but were unable to, this was obviously a lie that tried to make out it was my fault that they couldn't deliver. Anyway the upshot of this is that I lost a days pay for nothing and not only did they not apologise, they tried to put the blame on me... I definitely will not be using curry's again and could not recommend their delivery/installation company to anyone.",2019-02-18
588,5c6b0f1497afa1057438c4c5,So disappointed AGAIN with Currys and their service.. bought a Hotpoint Washing Machine online from Currys in Oct 2018 and was told there would be a £50 cashback applied and this offer was valid until 09/11/19. When I went to claim the cashback today I learnt the promotion had already ended. Phoned customer services and explained I couldn't claim earlier due to building works at my house and therefore the washing machine installation was heavily delayed.They blamed me and said it was my fault by not going through the terms and conditions fineprint! It was clear that Currys put the headline as offer ends 09/11/19 knowing customers like myself may not claim immediately and lose on this offer. It should have been stated clearer on the headline when purchasing the amount of days the customer has to claim - but instead this is not shown upfront!!I am deeply disappointed with the Customer Services for not helping and misleading customers of their offers!!,2019-02-18
589,5c6aeb2297afa105f4421256,"I don’t normally waste time writing reviews but I am beyond angry. Me and my partner brought a fridge freezer from the GRIMSBY store in June which had a year warranty. Within 2 months the display had broke and the alarm kept going off. We contacted Curry’s who took no responsibility and passed us onto the manufacture, which again are a nightmare to get hold off. After a couple of attempts it was arranged for a technician to come out and look at the fridge (1 month later). My parter is self employed and took a days work off to stay in as they couldn’t say a time. The technician never showed up or contacted us. After trying to re-arrange an appointment multiple times we decided to live with the fault as it was impossible to get someone to care! Over two weeks ago, our fridge freezer completely stopped working. We contacted curry’s, the manufacturer and to my surprise no one cared less! Eventually (after 2 weeks) another technician came out, he said it was fixed. The next day it was still the same. We contacted the company and they said they’ve signed it off as it was fixed.Within that, we are heading to 3 weeks with no fridge freezer. I am 17 weeks pregnant. We went into curry’s and spoke to one of the managers, who actually helped as he saw we had been in there multiple times regarding this issue with no help. We chose another fridge freezer and put some MORE money towards to get a better fridge. Delivery was meant to be today - Only to be told it is going to be another week!!!!! We are beyond fumming, seems most people don’t care, 3 weeks without a fridge freezer has cost us a fortune going out every night to get tea. Being pregnant and having nothing in the house is a nightmare. I will NEVER go back to curry’s, and would not recommend to anyone. We will see if the fridge freezer turns up on Friday.",2019-02-18
590,5c6a8d8c97afa10734cefdc2,"I have seen the awful ratings on here and I am not surprised at all. I have had a similarly awful experience in ordering a much needed washing machine for installation, which has still not arrived, and the responses I am having from the customer service team are shocking in that they are not taking me seriously.The original delivery day was Friday, I received a call from the drivers saying they were here but looking for parking. And I saw them, however 30 mins later they were gone with no warning, and didn't answer my call. At this point I rang in to the customer service desk - where I was told the delivery has been rescheduled for Sunday because: I said its quieter on a Sunday and because my address is on a red route. These are 2 lies. First of all it is a verifiable fact that I do not live on a red route, and I did not say it would be quieter on Sunday- else I would not have taken time off work on the Friday, nor did I say I was free on the Sunday. Never the less, I waited for 4 hours on Sunday afternoon for a delivery, that, surprise surprise, never arrived. I received an unprofessional text saying it has been rescheduled for Wednesday, again I have not said I was free on Wednesday. So at this point, I have been lied to, wasted 2 days - one of which was a working day, still don't have a washing machine therefore lots of clothes I am paying to have washed at the laundromat, and what is the response of the customer service team?? To completely ignore everything I am saying and telling me to email them back once I have received the item. What an absolute JOKE!",2019-02-18

Spoken to over 8 different people including managers over a number of weeks and they still don't know what has happened to the TV. My initial complaint case was closed for no reason and i only found out when i had no acknowledgement for weeks. I was promised call backs but no call backs were made. My initial complaint resulted in Currys confirming that they were happy that they have delivered the TV. It was definitely not delivered to me! There must be issues internally with their communication and major issues with the people they use to deliver the goods! Not surprised if there is a scam going amongst the delivery drivers! How can you have a delivery policy that accepts any signature as a form of proof of delivery?? Any bloke off the street can sign for your good then!!!

I've used the washing machine 3 days after and saw this big pool of water in the kitchen and ended up cleaning the mess for about 20min likely got solid wood so easy to wipe off the water. I rang the customer service and reported the improper installation and all they did was rearranging the installation as oppose to offering some sort of compensation for the inconvenience caused by their staff. They said they don't do compensations and that they also don't have a complaint department so really you end up very very frustrated and unhappy with their arrogance. I've delayed my washing even more as a result. A day after the call they have arranged for a team to revisit to rectify the problem. Turns up I get a call from the guy scheduled for the appointment telling me he's been called back at the depot and he has to cancel the appointment but will try make it tomorrow.....What is this seriously???

Subsequently, I delayed delivery until February 1st 2017 (the day I moved into my new house) on which date the product was delivered to me. I didn't get a delivery note as such and only was required to sign for delivery on a tablet. On or about mid February, I noticed when I installed the product that it has a dent in it. I was prompt in letting Currys know of this issue and they told me to contact SAMSUNG to get an uplift number before I can use the product. I did this and got the confirmation from SAMSUNG to continue using the product and that the product was out of stock and will be replaced once product becomes available. Having no further communication from SAMSUNG, I phoned up a month later and SAMSUNG asked for my receipt and a picture of the dent (along with serial numbers, etc.) for the product. Then I didn't hear back from SAMSUNG for a while and when I phoned up again they said I need to provide my delivery note to confirm that the product was indeed delivered on 1 February (because SAMSUNG informed that your policy is that only defects reported in the first month will be actioned for replacement - which I did). I informed I don't have a delivery note and SAMSUNG informed me I can contact Currys to get this. I contacted both Curry's online customer service and visited the branch but they don't have a delivery note as such stating the date of delivery. I gathered all the documents they have available in their system and forwarded to SAMSUNG. Subsequently I talked to a SAMSUNG customer service representative and explained the issue. I asked the representative to get in touch with Currys directly as the OBLIGATION is with SAMSUNG to ensure that my needs as a customer are met (after all it is a SAMSUNG product that I bought). The representative spoke directly to Currys and got in touch with me saying that I am indeed right and Currys are not able or willing to give SAMSUNG (or me) a delivery note. Then after some more discussion, the SAMSUNG representative promised me that the issue will be raised to her superior to deal with and assured me that my case will be resolved promptly. I received no further correspondence from SAMSUNG. Fed up, I sent an email after another couple of months. And we are back to square one on the delivery note. Is there some communication issues at SAMSUNG or are you/your colleagues not documenting conversations? Why am I explaining myself 10-12 times to SAMSUNG? As far as I am concerned SAMSUNG provided me a faulty product that was distributed to me by Currys. Through early 2018 SAMSUNG and Currys were in discussion about my case and Currys informed me they will deal with the problem without SAMSUNG. I have received no further communication.

Apple keyboard space bar stopped working, bought a replacement, non apple, from Dunfermline store, was told by staff it would work, it said on box it would work, I didn’t.My Apple Mac is up to date. Would not connect. Took it back to blackball store, he tried it on a small iMac and it connected, I told him it does not in ours and asked him to replace or refund, was told him basically tough luck and no can do. I was quite taken aback by attitude and manner and demanded to see manager who was very good and being it was only £25 would refund or replace. Went back to original guy who was very rude, I.e acting like a spoilt child and he in a very immature manner did the transaction, I was pleasant and said thank you and goodbye he ignored me.If it wasn’t for the manager I would never buy anything again from pc world.Customers beware if you open box, there is no refund or exchange.So much for consumers rights.Well done managerSandy",2019-02-13

Took an item back that I had purchased online 3 days after receiving it by DPD only to be told that they don't do refunds for items purchased online and that they would have to send it back to the warehouse for the online people to do refunds. This is contrary to what their website says and meant a wasted journey for me.Marcus, no explanation. He didn't even examine the goods but just said that it was the procedure for goods bought on your website. In truth I just think he couldn't be bothered.

We had no email or text to have a slot time. I phoned currys to be told that they tried to deliver the fridge at 7:50am and they said the gate was closed with a pad lock on!

The man said are delivery slot was 8-10 when we wasn't even given anything! After a phone call to curry’s I was told they tried delivering it at 7.50 which is not in our time slot..even though we wernt Given one could only get the next delivery for Saturday morning so once again me taking off another day off work when having work booked in!! Really not happy about this as there was no effort made from the delivery drivers to even open the gate to knock the front door!

I phoned customer services and was told to take my receipt into store where they could check whether the price should have been £399. I did this only to receive a load of twaddle from the manager there who said that ""we don't know what the prices are going to be from one day to the next "" In other words I could pay £399 one day, £499 the next and then £399 the day after that. What a load of rubbish this is. If this is true then Curry's/P C World have very bad customer & business practice.

638,5c616d7b97afa10b687a29e5,"As a single parent working full time I worked hard to buy my son a TV for Christmas in November 2018. It was opened Christmas morning and left boxed until 6/1/19 when it was discovered the screen was smashed. I immediately contacted Curry's who arranged for it to be collected and a replacement sent. Due to a number of mistakes made by DPD (resolved sufficiently via their complaints dept within 2hrs of them receiving the email) I am still without a TV. Curry's emailed to say the TV originally bought was end of the line and out of stock and the order would be cancelled if they weren't notified by 19.05hrs on 10th Feb regarding me wanting a replacement. I called them at 12.40hrs on 10th Feb to be told they'd cancelled the order and refunded the money. When I raised a complaint, I was first offered 10% off the price of a new TV and then £49.80 off as an enhanced offer. For Curry's to believe that a conditional apology is appropriate is insulting. How I have been treated throughout this mess is disgusting. They have failed to contact me via email or telephone, despite having my full details, and I feel completely let down. I feel I have let my son down as he is still without his Christmas present and I am not in a position to get him a TV with the same specifications as the one I originally bought because even with the proposed £49.80 off, it would still be over £100 more expensive than what I first paid for the TV they failed to provide. Their lack of professionalism, empathy and understanding of the above issues are nothing short of disgraceful for a large high street brand such as Curry's PC World, and to only offer the above money off is insulting.Should you have similar issues, do not expect a sympathetic or indeed proportionate response!",2019-02-11

As soon as I walked in there was a large group of staff stood around waiting to help. I made my way to the tablet section, where a staff member called Omar came over to assist me. Once I told him which tablet I wished to purchase, he disappeared I assume to find my chosen tablet and took 7-8 minutes. When he returned we went to a table where we commenced with the sale of the tablet. He took me through a number of things like insurance protection for my tablet which I declined. He then told me how by purchasing this tablet I was entitled free McAfee security. He then told me the final price, which I was expecting to be £149.99 (that's including) . But this wasn't the case and he quoted me a price in excess of £200. But for some reason Omar had great difficulty adding my gift card to the sale. He asked me to move to a different checkout but the issue continued. I left the store, went to the Pontarddulais Road Retail Park store and made the purchase with no issues. But the member of staff there informed me that McAfee security was not included, and the other member of staff at the sister store was incorrect.

He started off talking about a wipe then started talking about a computer reset. I wasn't sure what he was saying. I agreed and paid £60.When we came to collect we noticed that the wipe was £30 cheaper. We asked for a refund. An engineer came out and spoke to us from behind a repulsive, large ginger beard. He spoke to us in a broad Scottish accent. I couldn't understand him. There was no refund.I complained to the firm online through Resolver but they were adamant that they didn't accept my case. Neither did they discuss the matter of the poor enunciation of their employees in any of their emails, just ignoring the matter. Then Resolver informed me that I had exhausted their process and could only progress by seeking legal advice.I then sent a last email to Currys PC World asking if there was a higher level of complaint, a trades body or a dispute resolution service. I never received a reply.I notice that the one star reviews of Currys PC World on this site are huge, much larger than the five star reviews. I will not use Currys PC World again.

This Company damaged us with 429,99GBP, which is the whole cost of the JVC Tv including with 5 years warranty which cost is 49,99GBP. Four weeks ago we had a issue with screen mirroring, the Tv stopped to do that. I called the Team knowhow service to help us. But the assistant offered me additional item, which is can connecting between with our phone and Tv. It´s cost nearly 60GBP. I was not satisfied. The following weekend we went in the Stratford store to the knowhow desk, beacaus we have well 5 years warranty, I don't want to spend more money for anything.The assistant who helped us, he controlled everything and after few minutes came back and told us the warranty cancelled and is expried. I shocked becaus we never ever booked appointment to repair and never called knowhow team before, because never had any issue with Tv, until now. So it means them system cancelled our warranty from purchase in the following month.He went on the phone again,to call the service and than he told us the warranty fixed it , and valid again, beacaus it was due to a system error. So he booked the appointment to repair, and the knowhow service took my Tv to repair service on 19/01/2019. On 24/01/2019 I received a message with a voucher code, to go the local store to use that. We went to Romford store, where the assistant printed the voucher to me, but the amount was really low ,what we paid for our Tv before. I called the service number and told them why is this amount so low, because I have a 5 years warranty. He said my warranty is not valid. And the Tv is damaged in the Transit when they took my TV for the repair store.I shocked again because they told me also the voucher code is wrong as well, so they can not give me anything. It was a nightmare, which is even not finished yet. I told them it was a system error, we did not cancelled ect... But they could not help us. The manager was rud and unhelpful and spoke to me sarcastic front of the lot of costumer.I feel degrading I did not do anything wrong, I am just a simple customer who bought pretty expensive Item.So we left the store with no TV, no refund, no voucher code, and so dregarding.After this situation I went back in the Stratford store, and a assistant who helped us before, printed all information about the cancelled warranty which one is was due system error. But nobody wanted to fix it. Everyone said different things.Even I did not know they redelivery to me another new Tv which going to be ordering and will be exchanged it is like for like. The guy told me in the store. Today after 4 weeks the TV arrived, but we send back straightaway, becaus the the package was damaged and really wet and the delivery guy confirmed and agreed it is a used TV!!!The promised me to call back after half an hour, but like always the never contact you.I wrote email also to the customer service, but they do not replay to me.I am competely not trust anymore in this company, and absolutely disappinted and dregarding.

The machine has been delivered today but of course, they did not set it up for me even tho I have paid for it.

They took it back. Payment was made for installation as well. - As I bought it through a Curry's reloadable card, they issued a card on their system which has not reached me yet. - They expected it to arrive in 3 to 5 days, it's been 3 weeks now. - Customer service team has no tracking id for a refund card worth £500, what a shame!! they seriously don't care about our money. - Each time I call them to enquire, only response I get is they have no clue why it has not reached yet. Not even bothered to give an alternate solution.- Also, they can't even put me through the Cards team so I can speak to them, reason being they don't have a number to reach the cards team. What a lame reason.- Did they even issue this refund?? We moved to a new place so now my family is without a fridge for 4 weeks, managing with food that we can't store for long, heading out almost everyday to manage groceries. For this inconvenience, they offered us with 10% discount that will only be issued as a gift card after I make the next purchase. What a scam!! Consumer Harassment!!",2019-02-07

Foolishly because they had already unpacked it I let them leave it inside my house on the understanding that it would be fitted within a couple of days. To organise this I had to return to the store for the instore team to sort. I got a mutually convenient installation date where I was expected to be home all day as they could not pin point a time to expect the installation team to arrive. I sat all day waiting, at 5.45pm I called the customer service call centre to enquire when they were arriving, I was told that the installation had been cancelled, system problem apparently. I made my feelings known and was told they would arrange again for the following day. I asked what time to be told I would, yet again, be expected to sit in my house all day as they could not give me a time. I told them that I wished to return the item as I was not willing to take another unpaid day off work just for the same thing to happen again, apparently the call centre could not do this and I was yet again expected to go back to the store for them to organise it. I returned to the store and within 2 minutes I had arranged for the item to be collected, although I have now got to wait another week for this to happen. So I have a major appliance blocking the rear entrance to my property for the next week, ridiculous.

I Was then told, there's none in stock anywhere.

When I got home the anti-virus and the cover deal that the assistant had given me was the wrong cover so yet again I had to then go back to the store and get that changed! I can only discribe the attitude from the customer service girl as quite frankly Rude! I do believe her name was Melanie. I explained that the tablet cover I have been sold by a an advisor was the wrong tablet cover and she agreed it was for an Ipad! I said the tablet I bought is on display to be helpful whilst she went to find me a replacement, she replied "" I know"" rudely which then put my back up, there was no need for her to speak like that so then I said you know what I'm p###ed off, I came in here yesterday to buy a product and then found out it was not in stock, why was there not a note to say that this was currently out of stock! If I was a manager I would have had a display saying we are very sorry this is out of stock, her reply was ""it's not our fault!.

Unfortunately my laptop died during the middle of my final pieces of assessed work for my degree. Visited Currys store number 1 and was recommended a Lenovo laptop based on what I had said I needed. Drove a further 30 miles to collect the laptop from another store. Upon arriving home we found the box was open and the laptop was already set up and the 30 day security trial ended before Christmas?? Wasn't informed this was pre-set up when purchasing. Laptop screen keeps going black for no reason and is so slow that it is unusable. Not acceptable for a new laptop. Tried to complain to customer services that said these issues do happen please visit store. Visited a further different store when I returned home to be told it is ""updating"" and was sent off again. I've since been told on the phone this laptop is not suitable for what I needed it for (NOT helpful). Webchat was going well as an advisor was attempting to sort my issue, until he closed the chat and ended communication. The second webchat, I was advised Currys are unable to assist me over chat which I explained was strange given the previous advisor was able to... Currys are obviously unable to take responsibility for the sale of faulty goods as sadly this is the second time I have purchased. Won't even get into the first complaint but customer service refused to take responsibility for a faulty tv that broke shortly after purchase (Samsung the manufacturer confirmed it was faulty to me).

We felt akward in our on home trying to make things work in his favorite really.He asked my husband to remove radiator which was blocking the main door.My husband said no problem,then he driver asked to remove front door due to getting fridge in to the house.We felt like he tried to make it in passible to deliver our appliance.We tired our best because we were desperate to have our fridge.Again my husband said no problem and start taking door of than before we know it the driver turn a way and enter the van before we know it he were gone!We were without radiator and main door in cold condition with to young children and two dogs.Apart of the fact driver did not give us 30 minuts notice his behavior was not acceptable. Unfortunately we thing he just treat us like that because he notice we have an accent when we speak.He were just rasist and did not treat us like he should have because we were not from this country.We were wonder when his gone and when he comeback but that did not happened.I rong to TEAM KNOW HOW when one of the assistant told driver not coming back because my husband tock to long taking door of. When Question why he asked to take the door and radiator out and dissipater without saying anything no answer were giving.The lake of communication and unhelpful service make very disappointing no one really try to help us.We felt we do not have any option but to cancel delivery.I went to Currys when I origin bought an item.I asked to speak with manager,Mark came I have explains the above situation .He also asked Adam who assist us when we purchase item.Mark try to find out what has happen and why driver left us without any explanation.He make few phone calls, he said the best what can be done in this situation will be to uncancel delivery because this way I will not lose my item.which was popular and there were people waiting for it.So I agree to do that.Shortley after another phone call Mark told me he manage to do that and tomorrow he is not at work but Adam will give me a call back with delivery date.Mark also add extra service of removing and installation back of door of fridge freezer to making things go nice and easy.On Sunday morning I received phone call from Adam with information delivery was booked for Wednesday 09.01.2019. Shortly after I received text message from TEAM KNOW HOW that is great and my order is in stock.Will be delivery on Wednesday 9.01.2019.Then another text message on Monday with remainder that my order will be deliver on Wednesday.At that point my second weekly shopping were due to arrive; first were on Saturday second Wednsday.I spent over £180 pound for a shopping in result I have to get rid of all because we were again without fridge freezer.On Wednesday LgFRIDGE FREZZER did not arrived again!When I rang to TEAM KNOW HOW they inform me my order were cancel by the coustumer which is not true because I did not cancel that order.Again we were so exiting to finally get our fridge freezer so I can coock and fed my family. Unfortunately dissapoitment again.This time I went to Currys I was in tears I felt frustrate and upset with what has happend. I never expect buying something so expensive it will be so stressful and unpleasant experience.I ased to speak with Mark again as he were dealing with my redelivery last time.Again after few phone calls Mark told me My LG fridge freezer is out of stock and that is way was not deliver.But I do not understand why you rearrange delivery and send confirmation 2 text and phone call from Currys assistantships with confirmation of the delivery if you did not have my fredge freezer. More importentley why no one even bother to contact me and explain that.Me and my husband we waist day from work because we know we need to get out radioator and door out.We lost money on shopping which will not survived without fridge freezer.That was not acceptable.Mark told me what they done to me is unacceptable and he give me an option to again reorder LG GSL961PZB which was not in stock any more and new stock will come in the weekend but Monday 14.01.2018 I will know delivery date not before that.So that mean another week waiting and try living without meals and food with small children.Or I can change the model for the one which is in stock .In that time My hands were tid I just knew I need fridge as soon as possible so I decided to change model.Unfortunately the model which was in stock was more expencive and require plumbing(which increse coast even more)I spent another 179 pound on that Wednesday only to get my dream fridge freezer next day.It was a long journey for me to stay your costumer after what has happens with my order and I was so dissipated I went above my budget so much to stay with Currys and finally get the item which I bought.I am disappoint I did not received any further discount or recompensation for all I experience I have with Currys. What I do not understand is why driver left my property without saying anything and asked for additional service like removing door from the fridge because in his opinion fridge will not fit. I am not sure if you took to the consideration fackt we were so long without fridge because of that that driver. Finnly were the fridge were deliver by other drivers on Thursday the 10th of January 2019 who told us the door removal service is not nessesery and LG fridge freezer will fit without a problem. Especially when the main door were removed. All that hassle, stress and long waiting time which in the end has impact on our family life. Pulse additional cost of changing model of the £179 just to get the fridge next day pulse paying for a installation by professional plumber",2019-02-04

687,5c579b4a97afa109c496d7d2,"I bought myself a HP laptop from Currys PC World which was working well for 2 years and then unfortunately just as the warranty expired the screen broke (typical). I like to consider myself a savvy shopper so I went to a few computer repair shops where I received quotes ranging from £80-£110 to replace the screen with a new genuine HP screen, some of the repair shops even offered a same day service! Foolishly, I decided to show brand loyalty and have the screen replaced through the Curry's TeamKnowHow repair service. I was told that I would have to pay £60 up front for ""diagnostics and labour"" and then whatever the parts cost, they also guaranteed that I would have the laptop back within a week. A few days later I received a phone call saying that the new screen would be £65 (bringing my total repair cost to £125). It is a clever tactic that they employ, as because of the non-refundable £60 fee that I paid upfront I was financially committed to the transaction. I reluctantly agreed to the repair. A week had passed and I went to pick it up, and to my horror the screen had been replaced with a new screen with dead pixels on it. It was immediately sent back to be re-repaired! Another week elapsed and I finally got back a working laptop!Given this calamity of errors, I sent multiple letters of complaint to The TeamKnowHow service where they eventually, begrudgingly gave me a measly £10 refund.In Summary: If you want to pay over the odds for a faulty repair and be without your computer for 2 weeks... then Currys PC World is the service for you!",2019-02-04

Knowhow said I had to have an engineer visit (5th in total, 3rd for this machine). They wouldn't just collect it as I am fed up and want rid of it. Said it was the store's problem. Store initially said it was for Knowhow to sort. However, a trip to the store and manager spoken to sorted out a collection on a saturday so at least not another lost day off work.

690,5c57596397afa10ac087228a,"Ordered a new Washing Machine and Tumble Dryer. The Tumble Dryer arrived and it was so severely damaged it must have been dropped from a forklift. I phoned Currys and arranged delivery of a new item and collection of the broken one, that took another four days to be replaced.Once the new Dryer had been delivered, I finally began to install the Washing Machine. The water was connected and turned on, the washing machine then filled with water even with the door open and began to overflow. My neighbour who is a plumber looked at the Washing Machine, checked all the connections and confirmed there is a problem with the machine, the inlet valve appears to have failed and needs to be completely stripped out and replaced.I reported this to Currys the following day and after more than an hour on the phone, I was told I was not allowed to get a new machine sent out and Currys would not offer a refund until an engineer comes out to check it. Engineers are only available weekdays and the only time window available is ‘all day’ - so I need to take a whole day off work, not being paid waiting for an engineer to come out and confirm the machine is broken.I repeatedly requested a refund to allow me to buy from a better site like AO.com or Appliances Direct so I wouldn’t have to take a day off work unpaid and wouldn’t have to go several more days with no washing machine or dryer, but I was told by the rather rude customer service rep, that it wasn’t possible to get a refund, because that wasn’t procedure - the best I was offered, was to be sent the Terms and Conditions so I can read through them, thanks very much!So, more than a week on from giving Currys hundreds of pounds for new appliances, I’m still without any way to do laundry, as well as being hundreds of pounds out of pocket taking a day off work, with the prospect of a new machine a week away, at best!All companies make mistakes, things go wrong, I fully appreciate that, however, it’s how a company acts after the mistakes happen that define them, and based on this experience, I’m never buying from them again.If you don’t want to experience poor service like this, I’d advise anyone to purchse from better websites such as AO.com, Appliances Direct, Marks Electrical etc - anywhere but Currys.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------UPDATE - 4TH FEBRUARY As you'll see, Currys have commented asking me to provide more information about the order - which I sent off as they requested.Unbelievably, I received an email back telling me they 'have the right' to inspect the item'.No mention of the fact the Tumble Dryer was dropped from such a height it probably broke the concrete floor of their warehouse but they still sent it out, no mention of the loss in earnings from me having to take a day off work unpaid, no mention of the fact I've not been able to do washing for a week - all they do is quote their T&Cs back to me.That is further evidence of the type of company they are:-------------------------------------Emails below:Morning James,Thank you for your email. I was sorry to learn your washer seems to have developed a fault so soon after we delivered it for you. Having checked through our system and reading through your complaint, at present I must concur with my colleagues in that we do reserve the right for the fault to be confirmed, particularly as we did not install the machine for you. I would be more than happy to arrange a visit on your behalf. I would require the serial number of the appliance. Once this has been done, I can assist with organising an exchange for you. I look forward to hearing from you. Kind regards, My reply:Yes I understand in your small print you have the 'right' to inspect this, but the main problem here which no one seems to be grasping is that I now have to take an unpaid day off work to allow you to come and inspect it - that will cost me around £400 in lost earnings.The fact that it is not just one machine that I have had a problem with, it's both, should mean the automatic stance from Currys is to help me, rather than pick up your T&Cs - that's the point of my complaint. The Tumble Dryer was delivered so badly damaged it must have been dropped from a forklift or from the back of a lorry, there is absolutely no way whoever dropped it did not know it would have been damaged beyond repair. This shows complete negligence from either the warehouse workers or the delivery drivers (see image attached showing the damage).My point here is, as written in my review, that the whole service from Curry's/PC World is appalling - I'm now into my second week with no way of doing laundry - one machine had to be returned taking several days, the other machine is broken too and all your company are saying is 'you have the right to..' - that is terrible, you'd think your priority would be getting me some working machines that I have already paid you for without me having to lose out on hundreds of more pounds because I stupidly decided to order from Currys/PC World.I was asked by Currys, who commented on my review, to send you details to look into this, but all you've done is waste even more of my time by making me send several emails only to be told exactly the same thing from you that I have written in my complaint! Whatever the outcome of this is, I will be pursuing a refund for this order because this 'We have the right to, read our T&Cs' is exactly what consumers hate. I'm hundred of pounds out of pocket, have gone more than a week without being able to wash my clothes and have wasted hours of my own time - all because I chose to buy from Currys/PC world, big mistake I won't make again.Now unless you have any constructive outcomes, please don't waste any more of my time repeating what your T&Cs are.James",2019-02-04

We obviously, asked why it was being advertised and he said he didn't know but would get his manager. Words fail me regarding the attitude of this manager, who said that this only applied to AEG products. We asked why it did not say this on the sign and he just shrugged and said that was the offer. I said ""so you want us to pay £90 to plug it in and turn a few screws?""

699,5c56e8f597afa10ac086fa27,"I can honestly say I have never received such an appalling experience in my entire life. Curry’s are a company that show no care for their customers or employees. My wife purchased a laptop 369 days ago that has never worked, we have sent it back in the past as it stopped working and asked for a refund or replacement. The answer was no! They would send it off for 10 days and fix it. They returned the laptop saying it was fixed, it wasn’t. Took back today to be told by the staff member the laptop was not fit for purpose and we shouldn’t buy any laptop with an A processor and added he couldn’t give a refund as it would come out of his wages. Having worked in retail for 25 years at a leadership level with a large brand I fully understand the need for excellent service and a fix it now attitude, sadly the leadership at Curry’s obviously doesn’t understand or have the ability to value the customer. No in store Managers, really? Staff have to phone in front of the customer to get an answer. That really is pathetic and I am sure Curry’s has a one way ticket to receivership having lost its ability to relate to its customer. I for one having spent thousands of pounds over the years in Curry’s will never step foot in a Curry’s again. I will also tell anyone that is willing to listen what an appalling company this is. Shame on you Curry’s. I feel very sorry for the front line team who have no leadership to look up to and may ultimately lose their jobs. This is the first review I have ever written so I am certainly not a serial complainer. Use at your peril. Thanks",2019-02-03
700,5c56d4df97afa10bf0763b6e,"In short, very frustrating and unimpressed with the level of service, as the one star would suggest.I don't often give low ratings, in this case I had to make an exception. Let me explain why, this will take a while!I initially looked at the PC World website and found a laptop that suited what I was after. I would usually just order it online, but it came in two colour options, silver and black or grey, the website photos looked the same so I thought I'd go and see what they look like in order to make a decision. Also it would be handy to have it straight away rather than having to wait for delivery. I had a look to see if my local store showed both in stock, it didn't, but the High Wycombe store did. It's half an hour away but I thought in order to get the one I like the best, by actually seeing them in person it's worth an hour round trip. After getting to the store and spending a while wondering around the seemingly randomly placed laptops (as in, there was no order to them, not all one brand or one price point in one place, nothing logical to the placement in order to help you find a particular model) with no staff forthcoming, I continued to look until I found the one I came in for. There was only one on display and no indication of which colour it was so I looked around for a member of staff. There was a helpful sounding young chap in the area but he was engaged with another customer. I thought I may be able to just wait until she had been seen to and then ask for his help. Annoyingly however, she seemed to have absolutely no idea what she wanted and was pointing randomly at completely different laptops, asking each time ""what about this one?"" her young son, who it appeared the laptop was for, stood silently by as the member of staff effectively read the card in front of the laptop to her. Now I understand that some people need help deciding but there were no questions being asked to narrow this down as she jumped from a 32Gb Chromebook to a 1Tb laptop with no helpful advice as to how to make a decision. I figured this particular member of staff was not going to be free anytime soon as although he seemed helpful he clearly had no idea how to determine what his customer needs are in order to find them the right product. So I was on the look out for someone else, however every time I caught someone's eye they veered off in a different direction. I eventually walked right up to a staff member walking by and said excuse me, he merely wafted his hand at me and said something like, I'm just doing something. He continued walking to meet another member of staff who was, I initially thought, helping a customer who was sat in front of him. However they then both walked off to the front of the store to talk to the staff at the front desk, leaving the girl I initially thought was a customer sat at the computer terminal/till. I waited a little longer and looked around to try and flag someone else down, whilst starting to wonder why it was so difficult to buy something. After another couple of minutes I gave up and walked to the front of the store where a man in a white shirt, who may have been the manager, although his attitude and actions during my visit suggested otherwise. I asked him if he could find someone to help me as I'd been trying to get someone's attention for a while and his staff were either busy with other customers or appeared to be walking around (figuratively) holding hands, and explained about the two members of staff (previously mentioned) that walked down to the front desk together (they were still there). He asked what I needed help with, I said a laptop, he said if I waited by the laptops he would get someone for me. He then proceeded to walk a circuit of the store coming up empty handed until he got almost back to me, at which time one of the two that walked down to the front desk was back, with a duster in his hand apparently cleaning something. He pointed him over to me and I explained that I wanted to buy a particular laptop but was unsure what colour option I would like as both images on the website looked the same. The website showed that they had both in stock so I've come to see them in order to make a decision. I showed him the one on display and said I wasn't sure but would assume this was the black and silver one as it was, well, black and silver. He looked confused. I explained again. He asked me to wait while he asked a colleague ""because he didn't usually work in computers"". He found his colleague immediately, as he was standing talking to the previously mentioned seated girl. He tried to explain to his colleague, failed, I explained. He said they couldn't open them to show me but he could show me a picture, great I said as long as it's not from your website as they both look the same, that's why I'm here. He asked his colleague if he had an iPhone as he obviously didn't believe what I'd said, he got a blank look, a shrug and a mumble in reply. I had the tab still open on my phone so I pulled it out to show him. They had a brief discussion in which it was suggested the manager would have to deal with it. I simply could not believe this was such a difficult request. Then, with no referral to the manager, I was shown to a completely different laptop and told it was the same as the grey colour. It looked very similar to the display model which they seemed to think was the silver version because it had a black screen surround and the description said silver and black or grey. Which lead me to believe the grey version would not have a black screen surround but a grey one. I mentioned that what he'd shown me as the two options looked very similar, to which he said this one (grey) didn't have a brushed looking finish and was very slightly darker. I thought it was odd that a manufacturer would offer two colour options that were virtually identical, but manufacturers can be weird like that sometimes but also figured the screen surround would be the main difference. I was obviously not going to be able to see the two options side by side like I'd hoped, but I preferred the slightly darker unbrushed looking finish and the lack of black screen surround, so asked for a grey one. I thought I would finally be on my way with a laptop, not quite yet! He then went through his rather clumsy sales pitch for a package deal including Microsoft Office and security software which would save me £100, but would also cost £79. I declined as I'd rather choose my own addition security software if I felt I needed it, (Windows Defender for Windows 10 is reviewed pretty well it seems), I don't need Microsoft Office (similar free options are available) so it was rather expensive for something I didn't need. He was apparently so surprised he asked again, I hadn't changed my mind in the five seconds that had past, so again I declined. He said he would go and get it for me. While he was gone 'the manager' walked by and asked if everything was ok and was being seen to. I quickly explained the colour problem and that his staff didn't know how to deal with it and weren't able to show me the options which is all I wanted. He was continuing to edge away as I spoke and then told me he had a queue waiting and would leave his staff to deal with me. I was rather surprised seeing as I'd said they hadn't been able to answer my only question. He then hurried to the front of the store where he stood for a moment, appearing to do nothing further, he then walked across the front and a little back into the store where he again stood apparently not doing anything. The young lad originally sent to help me came back in a few minutes, with the boxed laptop (the box was no help with the colour as it was just plain cardboard). His colleague popped back up and asked me if I wanted the security package, I still hadn't changed my mind so I declined, he walked off. The lad holding the laptop then seemed unsure what to do next. He looked around, asked if I'd like to take it to the till to pay but then muttered something about needing to find a free terminal and sort of walked around on the spot. He eventually walked towards the desk the previously mentioned girl was still sitting at, who as I said I initially thought was a customer, but it now seemed was not, nor was she a member of staff. He asked her to move and then proceeded to log into the computer to ring up the laptop. It surprised me that he needed to think about where to do this, particularly as this was where he was stood before being asked to help me. Once seated he asked me yet again about the security package, yes you've guessed it, I hadn't changed my mind and declined. He said, so just the laptop then? No security? I thought this was rather misleading as the laptop will have Windows Defender (rather than none which saying no security inferred) and what they were trying to sell me was additional security. Anyway, as I'll choose and install that myself, if I decide to, I did not require this additional package, so again declined. He finally asked me for payment and I was able to pay and leave.I was glad the experience was finally over and I had the laptop I was after, so I headed home. In hindsight what I should've done is opened it there and then. However I didn't, I opened it when I got home. I pulled it out of its plain cardboard box to find a brushed silver finish with black screen surround, which seemed to be exactly like the one on display. I figured he must've got the wrong one, checked the label on the side of the box, it said grey. I'm not sure what to say about that other than either the manufacturer is crazy and has just said they have two different colours but actually just has one and puts two different labels on the boxes, or the staff have no idea about the products they are there to sell. Either way I'm not going to put myself through another visit to this store, it'll do as it is.Seems they earn their money selling the security package!",2019-02-03

In our case and to cut a very long story short having suffered a family bereavement over the festive season they left us half expecting to see a ""Team Know How"" van turn up at the house at same time as the funeral cortege! Fortunately the Douglas, Isle of Man store has a young man called Luke who tried his very best to help and evidently managed to stop this visit for which we were grateful but other than him and the subcontracted Team Know How delivery people who are also helpful the whole system is shambolic in my opinion.

Why didn't anyone tell me about the established issue of screen burn with OLED TVs when watching channels that use logos and scrolling bars - not on pause. Currys certainly didn't make me aware of it when taking my £1900, and now my TV, which was sold on the basis of its excellent quality picture, has two horizontal lines running the length of the screen near the bottom. Currys' extended guarantee isn't worth anything. The Company is satisfied to blame me as the customer, suggesting that I have used the TV inappropriately - RUBBISH! If you are thinking of buying an OLED TV with Currys - think again.Reply to Ben: the Technical Team's default position is that any screen burn must have been caused by the customer through misuse of the TV - pausing it for lengthy periods etc. They insist on this, despite it being well established that screen burn can occur through normal viewing habits, where channels are viewed that have fixed logos or scrolling bars. LG recently had the decency to admit that this is a difficulty with OLED technology. I have recently read about a small claims court decision against Currys for this very issue, but with an LG TV. The customer was vindicated and received a full refund. It looks like Currys will only do the right thing by customers when they are taken to court.

However, over the past few weeks it has become apparent to me that not only do they not listen to consumers, but that they actively practice in lies and deception. I sent in my laptop for repair back at the beginning of November, due to a faulty hinge and because I kept getting numerous crashes. They then returned the laptop back to me repaired but claimed that I had a faulty battery and that this was the source of the crashes. I went and purchased a new battery but nothing, however it would still charge from the mains. I also tried a friend's battery with no luck. So I took it back in for repair.During this time, they sent me 3 different tracking numbers for the same item, all of which had the incorrect or missing information. Eventually the laptop was fixed but I received correspondence saying it was being delivered back to a different store. After finally managing to pick it up, I was informed that it had been repaired but hadnt undergone QA testing which the person behind the desk described as 'weird'. I took it home to find that the sound had stopped working and I was still getting regular crashes until it eventually wouldn't boot up. Again I took it in for repair. The employee behind the desk attempted to do a fresh install of windows onto my device which resulted in me waiting in store for over 4 hours, after which I was still left with a faulty device after they said there was 'nothing they could do'. I ended up AGAIN sending it off for repair. Having them replace the motherboard and installing Windows 8 on my previously Windows 10 device. Same issue once more, regular crashes and I took it in for repair once more. By this point it had been nearly 3 months that I was without a laptop which has had a substantial impact on my work. After reading through the terms and conditions of my service plan I decided to request a replacement device as I could no longer go without my laptop, and I didn't trust that it would be fixed after the repair. I spoke to a customer services agent named Rebecca who was very apologetic and said that I would be sent a voucher that would entitle me to a replacement and that I could expect this within 3-5 days. On the 6th day with no voucher I again called up and spoke to a customer service agent who told me that they had denied the voucher because the repair team believed it to be a software issue and would not cover it. I was then bounced around various departments before being spoken to by 'Tim' who spent the next 15 minutes saying that there was nothing he could do and that there was never a promise of a replacement even though this is exactly what was promised to me by Rebecca. The level of service I have received from Currys PC World has been absolutely appauling and I feel like I have been paying for a service that they have no intention of honouring.",2019-01-30

Bought a dishwasher from them which was delivered on 20th Dec. Once it was installed I noticed it was leaking at either side of the door at the front. Phoned them on 28th Dec and agreed to have someone look at it (I had paid an independent person to install it so this seemed the least disruptive option). A repairman inspected it on 8th Jan and said it needed a new seal. Another repairman came to fit the new seal on Mon 21st Jan but it didn’t fit - it was much thicker and too short. I felt it for him as he double checked the model number to ensure he had the right one but although it should have been, it wasn’t. On the 23rd, with no indication of when the replacement seal would arrive, I decided that a month after taking delivery enough was enough and called customer services to get the dishwasher uplifted and a refund. I was told I would have to deal with the manufacturer direct to get an uplift number as they couldn’t for GDPR purposes (this is nonsense and contrary to consumer rights). They transferred me to Kenwood but I spent ages going though different phone options and speaking to different people I ended up back where I started. I phoned back, got a really good lady who agreed to deal with Kenwood after I refused to be transferred, and promptly phoned me back to say that Kenwood had agreed to write off the machine and would contact me with the uplift number and then I could get that organised and arrange a refund. She said I would hear within 72 hours.No contact received by yesterday so I phoned about 3.20pm. Had to explain the whole scenario again and was told it would be checked out and he would phone back. He didn’t phone back so I called again at 4.20 and spoke to someone else. Had to explain everything again and eventually he seemed keen to sort it out, looked up notes and saw that the previous guy had noted that he had got this magic uplift number but had not entered it in the system. The previous guy was on a break but if I held on he would speak to him when he came back. That sounded like a long hang on so he promised he would call me back in 10 minutes. He didn’t. I have spent several hours of my time on the phone getting nowhere.I can’t believe that all of the staff in customer services are either totally incompetent and/or lazy so assume that they are trained to behave in this way. Shame on you Currys! I will be taking this advice from Which Legal Services but what about elderly and vulnerable people who don’t have the energy to deal with this. Shame on you!",2019-01-29

Took back and asked to be able to exchange and pay extra for a better TV, no was sent for repair again. Got it home and still had the same fault! Spoke to someone at customer service who found all my details on their database and put me through to someone that could help. Well, this man was the most unhelpful and rude CS person I've ever spoken to. Said he had no record of my purchase or details. Finally someone in my local branch saw sense, stopped trying to flog a dead horse and let us exchange for a better spec!

741,5c4f386a97afa10bf0737e24,"I purchased a Smart TV early January from Currys. Took home and set up. After a few days the TV lost the internet. It wasn't just a case of reconnecting as I didn't have this option. Called helpline and was told have to de-install then re-install unticking a box when option arose. Was told because TV made in Turkey it automatically searches for a turkish network. Anyhow, told this is a known problem and should now be sorted. No, it happened again a few days later and again and again. Having de-installed and re-installed several times took the TV back to the store. Was told no replacement available and not sure when they would be back in stock but I could wait for it. I said no, not if you don't know when. I asked if anything could be done on the price of another TV as all were more expensive. Told to go and look and found one that was 80.00 more. I said I am happy to meet half way and pay an extra 40.00 which I thought was fair. Again not in stock but told I could go and get from another store, all at my expense and more time. Basically told you might get 10.00 off but no more as they're fixed price. I said not happy due to all inconvenience I had, not to mention the getting the TV back by myself. After several discussions saying they sold me a TV not fit for purpose, not my fault no replacement so they should replace with next nearest in price. No came the reply. I asked for a refund and got one. Once home I called the other branch with number shown on their website. Once I'd got through and explained the problem told sorry we only deal with stuff bought on line, I'll put you through to customer service. Spoke to CS who said they would ring the store as there was nothing they could do ! Came back and said store not answering, so I asked for number for me to call before making a further journey, no we don't have the number only a transfer line !! really !! So only option to go there which I did. Same story only 10.00 off which I'd already spent in time, petrol and phone charges ! The store suggested I speak with Head office who eventually came back and said maybe could have 10% of the price of the new which would have meant 40.00 which I'd asked for in the first place.....However apparently it was up to the store to discount. So the manager was contacted and he said no.... 15.00 maximum....... so they have lost a sale and any future sales from me. I felt utterly let down and disappointed at their response. I still have no TV as I can't afford the higher prices !!! Thanks Currys ...... disgraceful service !! and I shall be letting others know ......",2019-01-28

753,5c4cb8fc97afa10bf072bcb3,"Currys- Knowhow have stolen my laptopI bought a top of the range Dell laptop from Currys in July 2018. In January 2019 the battery stopped charging and it showed a pop up window asking for the battery to be replaced because it was unable to charge. I spoke to Dell customer service and was directed to take the laptop to my local Currys to be repaired under warranty. I did so and they were very quick to take the laptop off my hands and tell me that someone will contact me by the 23rd January 2019 to give me an update. In the absence of communication, I popped into the store in Canary Wharf, London, today and asked one of the members of staff who told me that in theory someone should have contacted me but it all depends on who is on shift and whether they feel like doing so or not- and most would not do it. I asked if he could check the state of the repair and he accessed their system. While he was doing that, he said that I might have to pay to the battery as a spare. I argued that a very laptop battery could be considered wear and tear within the first 6 months of life of the laptop when it is still under warranty and he tried to convince me that Windows 10 is maliciously designed to drain the battery and cause this issue which is not covered under warranty. Once he accessed their system, he told me that my laptop needed a new battery. Genius! My laptop had already told me that 10 days earlier. I asked when it was going to be returned to me and he said that it could be months and that if I had bought a care plan it would be quicker but because I had not done so, as the majority of people, my repair was not a priority. He also said that repairs under warranty are at the bottom of the list. I asked if he thought that taking an expensive laptop off a customer and not providing an update for months was an acceptable service. He just repeated what he had already said and added that the battery had to be ordered from China and clear customs which would be the main reason for the delay. I challenged that my replacement battery had to be specifically order as a single item from China since my laptop was not unique. He then changed his speech telling me that my laptops needed a very specific and unique part. At this moment I felt that I had listened to enough nonsense and asked to speak to his manager for clarity. He deviated from my request to repeat himself and it was not until I had asked for his manager three times that he requested his assistance. The manager explained how the laptop is sent for repair and stored until parts arrived. He could not explain why I had not received an update and put a note on the system for Knowhow to contact me- which I very much doubt it will happen. I left the store empty handed, frustrated and determined not to purchase anything from Currys ever again. All in all, I have handed in an expensive laptop into the void of Currys- Knowhow and I might consider myself lucky if I ever get to lay hands on it again.End of the saga:After the response from this company to this review I contacted them just to e told what I already knew and to be given more porkies about being contacted with future updates. They also mentioned that under their terms and conditions I would be offered a replacement item after 28 days if the repair had not been completed. I never knew if the ""replacement"" would have been a new laptop or a refurbished one... Two days before the completion of the deadline I emailed them asking to either confirm that I could collect my laptop or provide me with a new one as a replacement. Two hours later I was called by someone from my local Curry's branch to say that I could collect my laptop. Upon collection the repair date was stated as 10 days earlier this meaning that my laptop had been sitting in the shop waiting for me to call. Appalling service, no apologise and no compensation at all. Avoid like the plague.",2019-03-14

When the delivery drivers arrived, they said they only had paperwork confirming installation of new machine. I had to forward the email confirmation of the order to my wife as proof of purchase of the collection/installation as drivers were not going to recycle old washing machine. When we used the washing machine on Saturday 19th January, the washing machine was faulty; it didnt spin out all the water and every time it was in spin cycle it would move across our kitchen floor which stretched out the connecting water pipe and caused a leak. I called Hoover and registered the issue with them and phoned currys for collection and replacement of the washing machine which was arranged for Thursday 24th January. When the delivery drivers arrived, they said their order stated delivery only and that they were not going to connect the replacement machine. When my wife advised them that we had paid for installation and showed them the original order email, they said it’s not on their paperwork for installation and they haven’t got time to install a washing machine. So they left with the new washing machine. I immediately phoned Curry’s to inform them what had just happened, it is unacceptable; I have a one-year-old child and we have been without a washing machine for over a week. I then re-booked the third appointment for friday 25th January. I wanted to ensure the booking was correct this time and asked the Curry’s rep (John) 4 times to confirm that he had booked us in for delivery and installation of the new machine. He confirmed this was correct. Today (25th January) I received a text at 10.13 stating delivery was confirmed for Sunday 27th January. I phoned Curry’s, and they said installation was booked for today (25th January) And delivery of new machine had been booked for the 27thJanuary. Obviously this just doesn't work and the new Currys rep couldn't understand why John had booked it this way. She cancelled the installation for today and rebook our 4th delivery and installation of the new washing machine for 26thJanuary.

After delivering a OLED TV with a smashed screen on Wednesday where fortunately I had booked installation so I could not be blamed for Currys' incompetence. New delivery today but they generate a new order number leaving off the installation. I phoned yesterday to point this out and receive an email assuring me that installation is included. At nine O'clock this morning I was phoned to be told it had been put on a van without an installer. I phoned customer services and got them to agree for the delivery drivers to remain as I installed and checked the TV. I was told that they would be with me in 30 to 60 minutes. 75 minutes later I phoned to ask where the were. Answer more than an hour away with a broken down van. They used that one when they failed to deliver a cooker last year. So not only do they unreliably deliver damaged goods they also don't maintain their vehicles. The good news is that I have cancelled and purchased the same item from a local supplier with next day delivery for two hundred pounds less than the Currys' price. They also actually looked as if they wanted to have a satisfied customer who would return to their store. Currys, of course, are being difficult about the refund.Update: yes very difficult they have just told me they are refunding £200 of the £1750 because the TV has been delivered according to their systems.

765,5c4b40db97afa10ac08303ed,"Not having looked at Trustpilot first, Curry's being a household name, I ordered a gas cooker with installation and recycling online. The quoted delivery date was confirmed, twice, by text with an afternoon delivery slot allocated. I took a day off work, waited until 7.15pm but nothing turned up. No emails or texts were sent but the delivery details were wiped from the website tracking page around 5.30pm. I was then left on hold on the customer support line for 40 minutes until an automated message told me I wouldn't get though as the call centre was closing. When I finally managed to speak to an advisor the next day, I was told they were having problems with the website and the delivery was actually booked for a week later(!?).Today was the second delivery date, due between 9.00am and 1.00pm, again confirmed twice by text. As before, I took a day off work but nothing turned up. Again, no texts or emails were sent nor was there any updated information on the tracking page. I managed to get through to the call centre at 3.00pm, to be told that problems with an earlier delivery had backed everything up and my delivery would be there within 45 minutes. At 3.45pm my delivery did arrive. As it turned out, I was told the cooker could not be installed so I now face the problem, if other reviews are anything to go by, of getting a refund.I don't take issue with the cooker not being installed. I am perfectly willing to believe the gas fitter and the delivery driver, who were perfectly pleasant and apologetic, that gas safety regulations prevent a new cooker being installed in the location of the old one. What I do object to is the chaos up to that point.As a contractor, if I don't work, I don't get paid. Curry's/PC World's unreliability is not just an inconvenience for workers like me.

After the third time trying to contact them and being told I have sent them an email with no reply, eventually some nice lady referred me to the store.So the guy at the store admits they made an error and then says mistakes were made on both mistakes, what are you talking about dude - stop deflecting the blame.

772,5c4af20597afa10ac082d5e4,"Thank you to all the disappointed customers who have wrote a review on this site as something needs to be done to make people aware of the poor customer service from such a household name in the consumer industry. Unfortunately, I read the reviews a little too late and became a disillusioned customer like the other 52% of you who gave a bad review. My husband ordered a washing machine and dryer to be delivered. They gave us a 4.5 hrs arranged time slot and although this meant one of us having a day off work, which proves difficult to do in many jobs nowadays, we organised it as we needed the appliances. After waiting in for the majority of the day for the delivery, a phone call was received after the allocated time slot to tell us that they wouldn't be delivering our items as they had run out of driver time. With little apology or recompense, they informed us that they could deliver it in 4 days time if they had enough availability but we would need to ring customer services to arrange this. To cut a long story short, we did this which proved a waste of time. There was no priority to us as the customer to rectify their mistake. It seemed that we, as the customer, could be inconvenienced and lose money as long as that didn't have an impact upon the company. My husband offered to collect the items the next day after work from either the depot or a local store but this wasn't an option either. They couldn't deliver it on a day we could be in because they weren't in the area on those days but were more than happy to cancel the order, followed by an explaination that once again, we would have to inconvenience ourselves to do this by going back to the store (more petrol money and time out of family time) to receive our refund. In the end, we decided to cancel our substantial order of over £1000 as we would rather give that hard earned money to another company who actually appreciate and look after their customers. I understand that things happen that can't always be avoided, but the actions of how a company deals with these issues speaks volumes. Hence, I urge other customers to look elsewhere if you are wanting to receive good customer service and be treated as a valued and appreciated customer.",2019-01-25
773,5c4ad5e197afa10ac082c605,"I placed an order for a fridge/freezer. Needing this urgently I paid an extra £30 for next day delivery. I got an e-mail confirming my order and delivery for the next day between 7am - 7pm, happy days right? Wrong!Took the day off and waited and waited, having no further communication about delivery issues I still thought all was good. I couldn't find a way to track my order online so gave the customer service team a call. They told me that my goods would not be delivered that day as my transaction was still be processed. I also had the pleasure of hearing multiple conversations in the background including one from another customer service operator telling my customer service operator to hang up on me and deal with another call. Thankfully my operator did not hang up on me.Anyway after expressing my utter disbelief and realising I would not be getting my fridge/freezer I asked for a call back from a supervisor. He called and offered my a refund for the service that I had not received e.g. my next day delivery. I think not giving me a refund would have amounted to theft but hey apparently I should be grateful. Got an e-mail the following day saying my delivery would now be the following week, more than 8 days after my 'URGENT' next day delivery.

774,5c4ac89b97afa10ac082bfae,"I bought an LG 55C6V OLED TV on the 17/3/17 for £1699. In December 2018 it developed a fault with the screen and Currys came to collect it for repair. On the 4/1/19 they confirmed they had received the tv back. On the 7/1/19 they called and said it needs a new screen. The problem is that the new screen would no longer have the 3D filter because LG don’t make the screen with the filter anymore.So I told them that is not acceptable and I would contact LG myself to source a screen with the 3D filter. I did this and LG couldn’t source one.So back to Currys customer services to tell them that I bought this tv for the 3D feature and the curved screen. They told me that because they can’t give me the tv back how it was when I purchased it. I could have the entry level B8 OLED or £1199 in store vouchers.I told them that the B8 is not equivalent to the C6. One it doesn’t have the 3D and 2 it’s not curved. If I’d have wanted an entry level none 3D none curved screen. I’d have bought the 55B6 OLED at the time and saved myself £500.I’ve spoken to at least 6 people at Currys over about 2 weeks and had to tell them the same thing over and over again. The last 3 people I’ve spoken to, I’ve asked them to escalate the case so I can speak to a manager or the person that makes the compensation offers. They’ve refused point blank and said this is all I can offer you. I’ve told them that the £1199 in vouchers is no good to me because I have very serious health issues that stop me from going into the store. Which is why I bought the 55C6 online in the first place. They came back offering me £940.57 in cash. For a 20 month old tv, that I can’t get back in it’s original condition through no fault of my own.I find this a completely unacceptable level of service as I have been a regular customer over the last 10 years. Buying all my household appliances from yourselves.Why will you not let me speak with a manager to resolve my case in a fair and reasonable manner? The situation appears to be a stalemate with your refusal to let me speak with a manager.UPDATE. 26/1/18Emailed the info Bow asked for below and all she emailed back was exact same offer as i posted above. What is the point of that? Still no call with a manager. Next step is an email to the CEO of Currys, Alex Baldock.",2019-01-26

They confirmed twice that this was indeed a valid code and would be applied in store. 30 mins later at the Bedford store and a dialogue between the sales assistant (who also called himself the acting manager), and online helpdesk, it concluded that no discount could be offered. There was a disagreement between the online help and the store (are they not the same company!!). I showed the sales assistant the code working online if I ordered for delivery. Nether the less, I walked away with nothing as the only offer was £20 off if I was to purchase a warranty. I then proceeded to order the laptop from the carpark of Currys with £40 discount code applied, with free home delivery. How does this work for Currys? Customer unhappy and Currys making sale with an additional delivery cost to bear. I also wanted Currys to know this was happening (incorrect information being provided) and the sales assistant replied that to be honest, he wasn’t sure who to tell but he would raise with his superior when he returned for holiday.....you would think that customer service was a priority for a retail sales company, but clearly not.",2019-01-20

The camera was on display and he went off to check the stock.Upon his return he informed me that none of this type were in stock and no other store had them.This was disappointing for me as I was very keen to upgrade my current camera. I asked of I could have the one on display but he informed me that he was not allowed to sell it, I left empty handed and will go to Jessops.Why couldn't I have been allowed to purchase the display camera? Poor customer service, not from the individual who served me (not his fault) but the company in general.",2019-01-20
810,5c44bae99d378007a406ab21,"Feel very disappointed today this is not the service I’ve received over the years from curry’s I tried to order a under counter freezer today as I’ve done before I always order online it’s usually so very straight forward but today I had a love 2 shop card. After ten minutes ordering the freezer I was having difficulty with the numbers on the card, I decided to ring and a ask for advice I spoke to a young guy that just told me some instructions and I needed to pay at my nearby store I didn’t understand him very well and he didn’t seem to care in helping me any further so I thanked him and ended the conversation.We have no car and my husband and I had to travel by bus plus a fair walk from the stop,We was served fairly quickly the guy who served us took the reservation number and everything was straight forward he asked us if we wanted insurance we said yes. This took him a few minutes we told him that we didn’t want to pay for delivery as we hadn’t got rid of the old freezer yet so we wasn’t in a rush he said that he could get it delivered for us tomorrow Monday 21st January we said oh right that’s great thank you never thought about asking him again if it’s free delivery because we had told him a few times and it’s rude to keep saying it.We left the store and had the long walk to the bus station when we got there we sat on the benches waiting for the bus it’s my own fault because we should of checked our receiptin store when I started to read it we had been charged £20 for delivery this was not mentioned once in the 10 minutes we was in the store. We had to walk all the way back to the store and ask a guy to look and he had charged us £20 for delivery when we said that we wasn’t in a rush so wanted free delivery. He had to credit our account and reorder for Monday 28th. This as really annoyed me because I always order my electricals from curry’s online but had to travel to the store because of the love2shop card it’s been soo very difficult today and very stressful I struggle to walk so we had to get a taxi home as it was too much for me to walk any more. I will never do it like that again it’s online or shop at another store, the member of staff should be aware of this so it doesn’t happen again to somebody else",2019-01-20
811,5c449ac49d378009a45f63d9,"Currys and Knowhow seem to have little regard for the customer and their experience. I ordered a Zanussi fridge freezer. The first issue I had was that I logged into your tracking service to see a message saying that you needed to have a quick catch-up with me. If you need to contact me, why wouldn't you just contact me? Why should the onus be on me to contact you? Particularly, when in this case, you've got a fault on your side. There was no fault from my side. Then I'm informed that it costs 5p per minute to call you. If you insist that customers have to call you about a fault that isn't there's, why not make it free?! I made the call but had to wait on hold for 10 minutes to talk to someone! The person I eventually spoke to then informed me that my order had been cancelled. So I've potentially paid 5p per minute and waited 10 minutes, all to be given the bad news that my delivery has been cancelled. He couldn't tell me why bizarrely it had been cancelled. I'm still none the wiser? So we rearranged delivery- for the exact same time and day I had originally requested! Why did I have go through this strange circus of wasting my time and potentially money, just to rearrange delivery for the exact same time and day I had originally requested?! It's troubling to think that if I hadn't contacted you- you may not have contacted me to say the order was cancelled and I would have been waiting around all day for a delivery that never came. So, as I said your colleague, put the order through but confusingly to me it was emailed to me as an exchange? Your colleague didn't give me any warning over the phone that it would appear in my email this way. However the last straw for me was when I went into the pdf receipt I saw that on this ""exchange"" recycling, which I had requested on my original order, had not been included. Therefore if I hadn't inspected this receipt properly, it probably would have meant that your delivery people would have left us with a bulky old fridge at our house on the day of delivery of our new fridge. So I got on the phone to ao.com and I told them what happened. I negotiated a deal with them where I got the same fridge and recycling for £553. The delivery is 2 days later but I think I'd rather that than risk Currys and Knowhow and any more bad customer service. I've had experience of ao in the past and they did OK. I went with Currys this time despite having several bad experiences in the past but you still couldn't come through. Obviously I've cancelled my order with Currys/Knowhow and got a refund. So ao's bottom line is affected positively, while Currys lose out on a sale that they could have had in the bag if they cared just a little bit more about their customer. Judging by what's happened to me, you seem to really believe in letting the customer pay for the burden of using their own time and money to sort out problems. You haven't demonstrated much proactivity.The above text is in fact just a copy and paste of an email I sent to Customer Services on 18/9/18. Do you think Currys/Knowhow answered?",2019-01-20
812,5c4499fe9d378009a45f6390,Got to give 5 stars. Contacted them online about dishwasher. Wanted to buy from curry’s but seen the identical product much cheaper locally. Didn’t expect a price match when asked as I thought they would make excuses but No they confirmed cheaper price was valid so price matched. Delivered 2 hours earlier than expected so praise must be given. Incidentally I posted a poor review about a month ago so only fair posting a good review. It’s easy enough to complain but should also post a good experience.,2019-01-20
813,5c4495f09d378009548c2900,"After trying to place an order online and was unable to I decided to go into store and place the same order the colleague in Northampton store call Ellie was very helpful and tried to place the same order online this again was unsuccessful she then placed the order separately and without any adjustments come up with the same price. I was then told 7 to 10 days for the order to come into store but would recieve a phone call to give me a collection date before this. on the 10th day the order still wasnt in store and i still hadnt recieved a phone call , i spent the next week trying to chase up where my order was which ment visiting the store on several occasions and also contacting customer services on a number of occasions each time i was promised a call back from the store which i never recieved . Eventually i spoke to a manager who proceeded to tell me the items were out of stock, yet i was shown on the computer screen when placing the order that all items were in stock', so where did my order go? Obviously at this point i was very unhappy as i felt like currys had taken my money but my items were obviously sold to someone else as they were now no longer avaliable . i contacted customer services once again and was told my items had been re ordered and should arrive no later than monday and also once i had them to call back and some sort of compensation/good will gesture would be organised for the inconvenience. Monday came and went and still no order tuesday lunchtime i called again i was told the store would call me back , eventually i was called by a member of staff to say she was currently on her way to collect my items from another store and i could pick them up later that evening . Eventually i had my items just the good will gesture to sort out now , after speaking to the customer service team today i was offered a measly 10% back this amounted to £22.99 not to be scoffed at by any means but i didnt feel this was adequate enough for the time , hassle and fuel i had used in chasing currys , the lady on the phone decided she would talk to a manager to see what else would be offered only for her to return to the phone call and tell me her manager had said she had already been far to generous with what she had offered and we should not even be getting that as it was only 1 failed delivery . Currys customer service both in store and through the call centre themselves is absolutely disgusting they do not care about their customers just the money sitting in their bank like mine was for over 3 weeks before i recieved anything, yet if i had of managed to place this order online it would of been delivered to store and ready for collection the next day through DPD but because i ordered through currys themselves its just as and when stock turns up on the delivery and if your lucky its then not sold to someone else even though they have took your money too! I certainly will not be using them again",2019-01-20
814,5c4494069d37800a80dc03cc,"would like someone to take ownership of my full complaint please and reply today On the 7the dec I called your customer services and waited over an hour to get to speak to someone , at wich time I was told the lines were closed and I would need to call back. On sat 8th of December I called again and waited 2 hour 45 minutes to speak to an advisor. I was calling as my hotpot t fridge was no longer working and all the food In my fridge and freezer had went off and I had no working fridge. After waiting nearly 3 hour an engineer was booked to come out on Wednesday 12 dec. I had asked to be re-inbursed for the phone credit I had lost due to the length phone calls and was told I would receive £30 for this witch I am yet to recieve . I asked to speak to a manger and was advised a manager was not available and would call be on Sunday the 9th between 10 am and 1 pm. I waited until 2 pm that day as no manager had called me back, I waited a further 45 mins trying to get through to your customer services before giving up. A month later still no manager has called me . After taking a day off work to wait in for the engineer to come on the 12dec , I waited in all day an no engineer came . On the evening of the the 12 I called your customer services again only to wait a further 30 mins to speak to someone , my phone credit ran out and I did not have the funds to top up. I would like it noted that during this time I have had no working fridge or freezer and I have had no where to store food for myself or my 2 children and I have had to buy milk , butter , yogurts etc daily as well as try and visit the shops each day to get dinners as I could not store any food. I called again in the 18th dec and explained the situation I was told that nothing could be done until an engineer came out. Please also remember that I have had no way of storing our Christmas food for Christmas Day and the stress of all this carryon as well as being out of pocket for all the food I have wasted and having to give my children money for school lunches every day at a cost of 1.90 per day each , I have two children , so daily this is 3.80, as we can’t store food for packet lunches I was told I had to take another day off work , Christmas Eve, (I work in retail and this is one of our busiest days) I would get an engineer out. I asked why no manager had called me on the day I was ment to receive a call and was told they had been busy!!! When asked when I would receive the money for my calls u was told a member of the payment team would call me in 3-5 days (I never received this call). On the morning of the 24 the engineer came out and told me I had a faulty motor and he fixed it, we then had to Rush and but our Christmas lunch witch was one of the most stressful things to do. I called customer services again on the 27the dec and quiered why I hadn’t received a call from the payments team, again waiting over 45 mins to speak to someone I was told they would call in 3-5 days.I called again on the 9th January to be told it was never put Thor properly and they would process it now . I still haven’t received this. On Tuesday the 15 jan a further call to customer service as my fridge freezer was not working again, all the food I had was off, the fridge warm and my kitchen floor covered in water , I was advised a new motor for the freezer would need to be ordered and an engineer would need to come back out . This was arranged for sat 19th of Jan. Again having to give my children money for school lunch everyday and no where to store essentials like milk butter etc the engineer came out on sat 19th, he replaced the motor and advised me it should now all be working. He said to go ahead and get my shopping in and by the time I was back it would be back to working fully. In his advise this is what I done to find the next morning (today) the fridge and freezer not working and all the food I had bought has gone off. I couldn’t even give my children a bowl of cereal as the milk had turned . Yet another phone call to be told I would need to take another day off work this coming Thursday and when I asked about what I do to store food etc and what reinburment I would be given I was told to store my food in my neighbours house!!!! This service has been shocking I would like you to answer me the following questions Why did no manager call me back when promised Why was I told I would receive the cost of my calls back in 3-5 days and a month later I am still not in receipt of them Why have I had to take 4 days off work to still have no working fridge and what compensation will I be given for this Why should I be out of pocket for all the food that’s gone off and a further 3.80 each day for my children’s school lunch and what compensation will I receive for this Why did I need to endure all the extra stress and increase my anxiety to have to shop on Christmas Eve for my Christmas lunch when I should have been able to do this weeks ago had I a working fridge freezerWhy was I advised my fridge was working and to go and purchase food when it was notWhy am I still over a Month ago still without a working fridge Why was I advise to store all my food in a neighbours fridge and finally why did I request under the new GDPR regulations that I wanted a copy of all the information you hold on me 4 weeks ago and no one has responded to me .I want this sent to the highest complaints manager and I want my questions answered , a compensation value offered and all the information you hold on me to my email addressThis is shocking service Sent from my iPhone",2019-01-20

818,5c444d399d3780089c811c92,"I am not one to write reviews but...Bought a laptop after 9 weeks it broke took it back and had to wait 10 minutes to be served no one was on the desk but we’re all stood around laughing and chatting. Then when I was served it was poor they never made eye contact with me or spoke to me much I told them what was wrong with my laptop they kept it and said someone would ring me which they never did. My mum went in and they said they’d recover all my data at the cost of £90 which you should not have to pay if the laptop is under warranty. My laptop was gone 2 weeks which I thought it would be done by. 3 weeks came by with a few text updates so I thought I’d go in and ask what was going on as I needed the laptop for uni! The woman who served me looked like she couldn’t be bothered to even be there and while serving me she started talking to other people and printing labels for other deliveries and doing other things which I thought was so rude.They said they were still waiting on parts. 4 weeks came and still nothing but a text so my dad went in and they staff were so rude and cocky he walked out absolutely appalling behaviour for staff to treat their customers like that. They told him it would be ready either later that day or the following Monday baring in mind I got a text the day before saying it was still waiting on parts. Tuesday came and nothing had been heard so I went in as I do not appreciate being lied to and as I was there my laptop was delivered and I received it back and left. I think the customer service at currys is absolutely appalling they are rude, arrogant and cocky, and half of them look like they don’t want to be there in the first place. This is no reason to be like they are to their customers! And as for the £90 I payed for retrieving my data and saying consider a reasonable repair and being left without a laptop for nearly 5 weeks is poor. I don’t feel I should have payed that £90 because a brand new laptop should not break after so little time. I’m just shocked by the seriously poor service I received. After the amount of money we spent there last year I will not be returning and I will be buying else where!

834,5c41f66f9d378009a45e9f6d,"Last week we ordered a new fridge/freezer and dishwasher to be installed and the old units to be taken away. The very rude delivery drivers firstly started shouting at me when they turned up as they got lost and then refused to back their delivery truck up to the house, even though there was loads of room, and decided to block my neighbours drive instead.When they removed the old fridge freezer they left huge scratch marks all over our wooden floor and flooded our kitchen floor when removing the dishwasher. At some point in all this they also got into an argument with my neighbour over the blocked driveway. On leaving they then left parts of the old fridge freezer on our lane as it was obviously too much effort to pick it all up.I went to run a cycle on my new dishwasher to find it didn't work at all and went straight to an error message and leaked. The repair man arrived a week later and found evidence that the machine had been dropped and was a total write off.Good job guys!",2019-01-18

837,5c41e3e89d378007a405cb7f,"WARNING TO CUSTOMERS DO NOT USE THEIR USELESS DELIVERY SERVICE! BUY YOUR PRODUCTS ELSEWHERE!!!😡😠 Your service SUCKS! I cannot believe an established company like yours operates with such poor standards. I ordered a fridge online PAID addition for the installation, recycling and a specific time slot. YOU failed to turn up on the designated day, I rang Customer Services, they said it was an update error (whatever that means!?!) but I gave it the benefit of the doubt because it was arranged for the following day; even though I have turned half my house upside down to make space for the drivers to make life easier, I unplugged, emptied and defrosted my fridge and freezer. The drivers finally showed up next day at 12:45pm (even though the time slot was 9am-12:59pm but whatever!) They knocked on the door and basically said they would not do the installation or recycling because there is no parking and they would be blocking the road and could they just deliver the fridge and arrange another date for installation and recycling. This is not possible for us because we do not have the room for it and all our food is out of the fridge and freezer, also I live on a small one way street and parking is a huge problem because there are several cars outside my house on both sides of the street and getting any parking is extremely hard because these cars do not move at all because of our inconsiderate neighbours who are using it as their own personal garage and hoarding all the spaces. I told the drivers just block the road people will have to just wait for you to be done but both of them refused RUDELY and this changed my attitude and I am not proud of my behaviour but I became very insulting. But having to wait around for 2 days and putting in the work to make their life easier only to be told they won't provide the service and product I PAID for made my blood boil!!! It's not an excuse for how I reacted and I regret my actions!I told them even if they arrange to come again on another day, the same drivers will have the same problem with getting a parking so you may as well just do it do now. But they did not comply and did not seem interested in finding a solution so I told them to go away and that I am going to call Customer Services, and the drivers attitude was as if he did not care that I was going to make a complaint.NOW on to customers services, so as you can imagine a person in my situation is going to be extremely upset and the person who handles my call is naturally going to get the brunt of it. In retrospect I should of calm down first before making the call, so when I made my grievance the person put me on hold to speak to the relevant person only to transfer me to another agent and not pass on any information regarding my issue and I HAD TO EXPLAIN IT ALL AGAIN!!! What kind of customer service is that??? Basic staff communication?!? Non-existent!!!So this agent just explained they could arrange another date but I told him LIKE I TOLD THE DRIVERS AND THE PREVIOUS AGENT...whoever shows up will have the same problem with the parking! I said if the drivers are willing to parking far from the house in order to get the job done there is no other option then to block the road! It seemed I was getting no where so I demanded a refund and filed a complaint! I spent almost £700 and did not expect service poor, poor, POOR service!!I will be taking my custom elsewhere!!!",2019-01-18

They came through the hallway into the kitchen, they we're really struggling to get the fridge freezer through the door. I advised them to go through the back garden but they thought they knew what they were doing. Anyway, as they were bringing the fridge freezer close to the door they damaged the door, the wood chip came away. Then they decided to bring it round the back. To which they were successful and bought it through the back garden. I stressed theve damaged the door, they took pictures I took pictures and said speak with the complaints department to which I did. Not only to find out the 2 delivery guys had reported they hadn't done damage to the property and the damage was already there... I was fuming. They basically lied. After 2 weeks of calls, quotes sending emails etc they refunded me £85 for the damage to the door and fitting cost. I was absolutely discusted with how they dealt with this.

Cooker did not arrive. Had text saying it would be delivered on Sunday 13th. Did not arrive. Several time consuming calls to customer services and I believe cooker will be delivered on 24th Jan. I will wait and see. The problem is that Currys do not seem to appreciate that when you pay £100 for installation and £15 for removal of old cooker it is necessary for the cooker to be delivered BEFORE engineers arrive or even for engineers to arrive WITH the cooker. If this does not happen on 14th Jan I will be cancelling my order and purchasing elsewhere. From this experience I have learnt to never buy anything from Currys again.

When we removed the bottles they were frozen solid even though the wine cooler was showing 12 degrees (very dangerous as could of exploded) I called Currys to ask if I could return the wine cooler for a replacement but was told I would have to have an engineer come out to fix it which of course would mean taking a day off work to wait in all day, I reluctantly booked the engineer visit with Belling and got a date for the visit of the 14th January and a time between 8am-6pm! The engineer came and seemed extremely unfamiliar with the wine cooler but did end up changing the main board and left with the less than reassuring note that it should be fixed but may need a part he doesn't have. We left the Wine cooler on and within hours the temperature display started displaying very strange temperatures between 16 - 25 degrees, we put a thermometer in the wine cooler which was soon showing a temperature of 3 degrees and also put a bottle of water in there which by the next morning was frozen. By this point I was sure I had done enough to warrant a replacement for the wine cooler so I called Currys who said i would need to talk to the manufacturer for an uplift code so I then spoke to Belling (Glen Dimplex) who said I had a sales agreement with Currys so they would have to provide a replacement, I went back to Currys with this information and was told that they would go back to Belling and get the uplift code for me, but Currys came back to me and said that Belling had reported that the engineer report states that the parts were replaced and the wine cooler was working so they would not provide an uplift code for a replacement. So after all this I still have a faulty item that has never worked regardless of when I purchased it, Currys are saying it's the manufacturers problem and the manufacturer are saying it's all fixed and its not their problem.",2019-01-16

Since it was my builder who ordered it, it was after 30 days that we moved back in and I used it only to find it was not fit for purpose. My builder contacted them since the order was in his name, Curry's refused to help. I've spent ages on hold to Know-how, no-one answers. Once Currys have your money they're done with you.

Having had a bad experience with Currys many years ago, I have never bought anything from them since. Yesterday's experience with my father in law's order only compounded my views on Currys PC World. Four calls to their call centre resulted in being lied to four times with three promised call backs which didn't happen and some nonsense about not being able to refund an item over the phone which they have lost (a washing machine no less!). My wife was also told she was holding up the line so other calls couldn't reach that agent! If they deliver an item and it's not faulty then you may have a good experience. However, anyone dealing with them post sale likely won't based on my own past experience.",2019-01-14

(It was broken - but that's another matter) A few days later I get an e-mail from another company asking me about my purchasing experience at Currys PC World.At no time did I give Currys PC World consent to process my personal data for anything other than the execution of the purchasing transaction.At no time did I give consent for my personal data to be passed to a third party company.I complained to both the third party company (MARUEDR) and to Currys PC World. Maruedr responded immediately and confirmed that they had deleted my data and also raised a case with Currys PC World. Currys PC World are (2 months later) still (no other word for it) pissing me about big time. They simply ignore the formal GDPR complaint I have raised and respond with inappropriate scripted nonsense from their first line helpdesk.Why is it that Currys PC World and other large companies can just get away with extracting the urine out of their customers and the law and NEVER get dealt with? The ICO in this country is an absolute disgrace - about as useful as a chocolate fireguard - so no point raising these concerns with them! Once again the 'little guy' who has all these laws and rights to protect him is just trampled over without the the slightest regard.I will never spend another penny in Currys PC World. Ever!----------------------------------------UPDATE FOLLOWING THE MESSAGE FROM 'AG' BELOW:I e-mailed as requested about 2 minutes after 'AG' posted his/her response below. I asked them to call me.

876,5c3ba40d9d378009345f4cb7,"Not even worth a one star rating. I can't even begin to describe how horrendous the customer service is here and how completely incompetent every member of staff that I dealt with was! I called to simply book in a repair for a dishwasher that I'd purchased earlier in the year. I was on the phone for 1 hour and 40 minutes and transferred to a different department a total of 8 times as not a single person knew what to do. Surely this is a common query?! Every time, I was assured that the next person would be able to sort out the repair. Eventually, I was charged £119 for the privilege and only paid as I was so frustrated to have already wasted so much time on the phone. I wish I hadn't now. I asked for a VAT receipt as I the payment was for my work premises. I was told that this would be emailed to me. The next day I received an email receipt (not VAT receipt as requested) so I replied and asked again for the VAT receipt, they then sent me a VAT receipt for the original purchase of the dishwasher, not the repair. After several emails stating specifically that I required a VAT receipt for the repair at £119, I still didn't receive it. Someone called me apologising and assured me that this was being sent by email and post. No email ever came and in the post was once again a general receipt, NOT a VAT receipt AGAIN. It's now been two months and I still haven't received it or a response to the complaint I've made despite forwarding them on a few more times after no response. I had a phone call a few weeks ago asking me what I wanted them to do and I said just quite simply sending me the VAT receipt that I have asked for over and over again. I also said that I wanted to enquire about compensation as so much time has been wasted trying to resolve this. I was told they would forward it on and someone would be in touch but of course in true Currys PC World style, no one has been in touch. I cannot believe that there are such incompetent people in the world, never mind all seeming to be working for the same company. I'd never buy from them again and hope that others read the reviews before wasting their time and money too.",2019-01-13
877,5c3b959f9d378007a4033f1d,"SUMMARYCurrys PC World now appear to be refusing my e-mails asking for them to stop e-mailing me (i.e. stop harassing me).Somewhat ironic perhaps?They also appear to be unwilling to remove my e-mail details despite an article 17 request under GDPR.In my opinion (based on their shambolic behaviour, breach of trust and initial failure to respond to the lawful process of GDPR) consumers should keep clear of Currys PC World; certainly they do not appear to have any respect for their customers.Furthermore I believe their request for contact (below) was just 'window dressing' for this website as it achieved nothing.FIRST POST 13/1/2018I bought a computer in PC World. To date it is fine with no problems and I'm happy with my purchase.It doesn't take much to imagine my complete sense of humour failure when I rapidly started receiving marketing spam from Currys; despite my explicitly and clearly saying 'No' when I bought my computer. In my opinion a violation of trust.Accordingly a simple and reasonable 'Please Stop' request was made to Currys PC World.However, their 'Teamknowhow' (perhaps that should be 'Team don't know how'?) just gave me links to their website despite my not setting up an online account with them - sorry, I'm not going to 'legitimise' this account (which I did not knowingly agree to) through engagement thereon.In my consequential reply to Currys PC World's response I both repeated my reasonable request to 'Please Stop' and (on the basis of their failure to stop) escalated this by instigating a request for my e-mail address to be removed under GDPR (on the basis this should bring their e-mail contact to a close).Unfortunately in their most recent (i.e. further) response Currys PC World ignored my legitimate GDPR request to remove my e-mail address (they have a statutory obligation to reasonably comply) and have not confirmed a cessation to their spam. So I am now waiting to escalate this to the Information Commissioner's Office as a non-compliance under GDPR; potentially a serious matter.Furthermore, Currys PC World are now aware that (on the basis their spam is causing me distress) I will be treating any further spamming by Currys PC World as harassment under the Protection from Harassment Act; potentially a criminal matter.What part of 'No' did Currys PC World not understand?Why are Currys PC World refusing the reasonable and simple request 'Please Stop'?(Rhetorical questions).UPDATE 14/1/2018So I responded to Currys PC World 'Trustpilot' request for contact. In their subsequent exchange today they clearly did not read the issues involved; simply repeating their previous 'mantra'. This leaves me with no faith in Currys PC World ability to deal with an issue even when presented with a poor on-line review..Accordingly Currys PC World have chosen not to confirm (1) that they will remove my e-mail address (as requested under GDPR regulations) (2) that they will stop spamming me.Accordingly this is to be escalated to the Information Commissioner's Office on the basis Currys PC World's choice not to acknowledge my GDPR request constitutes a refusal to comply with their statutory obligations thereon.UPDATE 15/1/19Currys PC World now appearing to agree to cessation of their spam but have yet to actually do so.Unfortunately in terms of GDPR in my opinion they appear to be acting like a petulant child through now seeking to obstruct my GDPR request; I suspect the ICO may not be too impressed with what I believe may now constitute bullying by Currys PC World (causing further distress).In this respect a legitimate GDPR article 17 request was made and if not acted upon by Currys PC World will be escalated to the ICO without further notice at the end of the statutory period upon which Currys PC World are required to comply (12/2/2018). After this date a breach of GDPR by Currys PC World may have occurred.UPDATE 16/1/2018Subject to final confirmation Currys PC World have now stated my e-mail details will be removed under GDPR. Had Currys PC World simply stopped sending spam e-mails when initially reasonably asked, this situation would not have escalated to this point with the consequential negative feedback. However, I protect my privacy and expect organisations to accept this. UPDATE 26/1/19Currys PC World are continuing to cause distress through its unwanted e-mails. As they are choosing not to stop (following my reasonable requests) this is now being treated as harassment.A further complaint has been lodged with the Information Commissioner.My GDPR Article 17 removal request now appears to have been ignored and they now appear to be refusing to stop sending me spam (i.e. stop harassing me).UPDATE 28/1/19Currys PC World now appear to be refusing my e-mails asking for them to stop e-mailing me.Somewhat ironic perhaps?",2019-01-28
878,5c3b933c9d378009a45c06fc,"(13-01-2019, sometime in the evening - edit for the timeline to make sense)Up until this experience I've generally been happy with Currys and they would always be in the mix when weighing up new purchases.That is now history; bought a high end Samsung induction hob with the full fix or replace service. It blew up, can't get the spares and the model is now discontinued so they wrote if off, fair enough, time for a replacement. The offered replacement was an AEG without the functionality that the Samsung had, even though Currys currently sell the follow-on Samsung model that is a direct replacement in terms of functionality, they even look almost identical. The value of the replacement offered is significantly under the original purchase price and the current model Samsung price, staff unable or unwilling to discuss other options in shop or via phone to Know-How. Staff friendly enough but no-one seems to want to or are able to make a decision and just pass the buck back and forth. Is there either real pressure, or perceived pressure, from management to fob customers off with cheaper kit ?Not impressed at all, so to save themselves less than £200 they now have an unhappy customer who will make every effort to shop elsewhere. I have serious doubts over whether the in-house additional warranties are really worth the money given the performance I've seen over the last few days.(14-01-2019 11:15), Currys have been in touch as a result of the above post, I have sent them the info they asked for, keep watching as the saga progresses.....(24-01-2019)After some to-ing and fro-ing Currys have made a goodwill gesture and given me a voucher to cover the additional £s needed to buy the equivalent replacement hob. It shouldn't have taken a bad public review and down-right stubbornness on my part to get what I feel is a fair result but if that what it takes..

After 5 attempts at phoning - none of the options were ""we sent you an email and you are getting in touch as a result of that"" - I got through to an assistant who frankly could not have been less interested in the facts. They tried to get me to the website to choose another fridge. After careful research, I wanted THAT fridge, not one that I chose in a few seconds. Assistant had a poor attitude in my opinion, if there was an apology (not sure there was) it was very grudging and insincere. My hazy memory of contract and acceptance tells me that this state of affairs - accepting a contract to supply that you can't fulfil - is against contract law. Assistant said I would get a refund in 3-4 days, the cancel email says that they didn't take the money. So now I need to go to my credit card and work out if they took the money or not as they seem to not know! All in all I am extremely disenchanted, and I still need a fridge.

890,5c39f58b9d378007a402c976,"DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY. I recently purchased a TV and television/broadband deal at the same time as I was told by the member of Curry’s sales staff (I won't name him at this time) that in doing so Currys would give me 100 pounds cash back. The member of staff told me that after I signed up to the broadband/tv deal and purchased a TV at the same time I would then receive an email with a link on it to claim my 100 pounds cash back. He said that this email may take a number of weeks as I would have to pay direct debit monthly instalments for the broadband/tv deal first to show that I am fulfilling the requirements of the contract. He said after I have made these direct debit payments I would then receive an email with a link on it to claim my 100 pounds. I made a couple of direct payments and checked my emails on a regular basis but the email for my 100 pound cash back never came. I then went into the Currys store where I made my original purchase (Scunthorpe branch) and was told that they do not deal with the cash back and that I needed to call customer services. After calling customer services they said they do not deal with the cash back deals and gave me another number for a said external company who deal with the cash back. I then called this company only to be told that an email would have been automatically sent and now it had past a 60 day cut off period and I am no longer entitled to the 100 pound cash back! I was never told in store when I made my original purchase that there was any cut off period for claiming, instead I was told to wait for the email which would take several weeks! I then went back to the Currys store where I made my original purchase to tell them what had happened and the member of staff who sold me the deal in the first place said he would look into this. A week later I received a phone call from this member of staff saying that an email would have been automatically sent to me and that it might have gone to my junk mail, but as it is past the 60 day cut off period I'm no longer entitled to my cash back! I told him that I have checked my emails, including junk folder, and that I have never received an email as I have been checking on a regular basis to claim my cash back. I also asked him why I was never informed of a 60 day cut off for the cash back when I made the purchase, to which there was no reply from him. He said he would look into it again as I never received an email. He called me back the following day to say Currys don't keep any record of emails sent, but one would have gone automatically and I can no longer claim my cash back as it was past 60 days!So when I made the original purchase I was told to wait several weeks for an email to claim my money, which is exactly what I did. But in doing what I was told it then put my past a 60 day cut off which I wasn't informed of. Also I was told that the email would have been sent, though they keep no record of this, but on checking my emails regularly (including looking through spam emails retrospectively) I never received this email. So now I am the one without the 100 pounds I was promised, after spending much time chasing the issue and for doing exactly what I was told. I find the whole experience disgusting and feel that Currys have held back on information during my original purchase and also not fulfilled their promise of this email, and in doing so have successfully conned me out of 100 pounds. It makes me wonder if this is how the company operates then are they to be trusted on any aspects of any sales they are making?",2019-01-12

Kenwood American style fridge freezer September 2018, on 2nd January the freezer side started making a loud buzzing noise by early hours of the 3rd it sounded like a motorbike was in my kitchen, and it had stopped freezing resulting in us losing a freezer full of food, spoke to team no how who were no help, engineer came out on Friday 4th at which point the fridge had stopped working, I had to ring them to find out what was happening, after having to ring back 3 times as people said they were putting me through to other departments I finally found out the engineer was waiting for parts, we have now been told it will be repaired 14th January, I'm so annoyed that we have yo have a 4 month old fridge freezer bodged up with parts, and then to add insult to injury they have informed me we can get £58 compensation for the food we have lost, I wouldn't advise anyone to buy from these",2019-01-11

Taking a 5yr old microwave back after I spotted a safety recall for it was pretty smooth. Despite (surprise, surprise) us lacking the original receipt they were able to quickly bring details of our purchase up and issue us a credit note for the amount.2. The door recently fell off our American style fridge freezer. Currys were exemplary with arranging a swap-out fo the entire fridge in a timely manner.

We asked the sales assistant if we could view text on the monitor or plug in the Laptop we had brought with to ensure the text displayed clearly, as the monitors were only displaying a carousel of images and the monitor would be used mainly for writing/editing documents. The sales assistant refused mentioning they would have to ""install windows on a laptop to show us Office 365"", bearing in mind we had brought our own Laptop with us, along with an HDMI cable. She reiterated they ""Don't have this facility in this store"", despite being surrounded by Laptops and PCs in a store that's called Curry's PC World. After checking with the manager, they again confirmed they could not assist. I made it clear I wanted to test the product fully before purchasing as we were looking to return a previous model we had some issues with. Poor customer service from a clueless team. Not the first time I've had poor service from this particular store and it's the last time we buy any personal or business products through Curry's PC World.",2019-01-11
902,5c38a8cf9d378009a45b168b,"My Mother-in-law took delivery of a cooker on Sunday 16th December, however the delivery men refused to take away the old cooker, leaving both cookers in her small kitchen, claiming that she hadn't paid to have it disposed of (but she had); they also refused to wire up the new cooker because apparently the electrics were incorrectly wired. The delivery driver was extremely discourteous to her, disbelieving of the fact that she had paid to have the old cooker removed and leaving her to try and negotiate the new cooker which was left in the middle of the floor. When I spoke to the customer service agent on the 17th, he arranged to have an engineer out on Friday 21st December to collect the old cooker (so 5 days of my Mother-in-law having the new cooker in the middle of the floor) and also to connect the new cooker. She is an elderly woman and it is ridiculous that Currys put her in the position of being without means of cooking far longer than she should have been and put her in danger to her person if she had bashed into the new cooker She called in the Council electrician the Monday 18th (who put the electrical connection in originally), to check the electrics and there was nothing wrong with the connection. They kindly wired the new cooker in and it is working perfectly. This was not the service that we expected of Currys, having purchased numerous items in the past. We were extremely disappointed that we experienced this and will not be purchasing anything from Currys in the future.",2019-01-11
903,5c38a84d9d378009a45b163d,"[UPDATE: Don't be fooled by Currys PC World replies to bad reviews, they appear to be automatically generated in a cynical attempt to save face. The reference number is meaningless and if you do pursue all they do is go back to the shop, which in this case further embellished their lies by saying I went into the shop with a tape measure. Now considering legal action..]Mis-sold and utterly let down. Spent nearly £600 on a new washing machine and having it installed, only to find it does not fit because it is 650mm deep and not 600mm as I was told by the salesperson in the shop. I stressed the importance of this because our previous machine sat in a built-in cupboard free-standing, not as an integrated device. I was reassured that this new machine was a standard size 600 by 600 and no deeper than another machine. The installer quickly discovered that this was not true, because the “add-wash” feature makes the door stick out more. However, having already taken away our existing old (but working machine) he refused to allow us to return the new one and insisted on turning it on, (which we later found out rendered it unreturnable). He told us KnowHow would be in touch to replace it, that this happened all the time and he was not allowed to leave the customer without a machine. We have never heard back from them. I have since been into Currys PC World three times now and after being reassured that I could exchange it for one of the many devices that will fit our cupboard, was then told that they would not exchange it. During my last visit I was told very rudely that we were using the device in a “non-standard way” and that the full dimensions are published and that it was my own responsibility to look them up. In fact, to this day I have been unable to find dimension information on Currys PC World website. I eventually found them (and measured the machine) on Samsung’s website where its net dimensions are still described as being 600 by 600, but also has a separate set of gross dimensions. More to the point when I initially went back to the original salesperson they showed me the information they had was 600 by 600. If salespeople don’t even know the difference…! Anyway when I raised this with the customer service person in store today he basically intimated that I was lying about my originally conversation with the salesperson. He also told me that we could have physically stopped the installer from turning it on. The cupboard was built within the last 18 months as part of new kitchen and so cannot be adapted with redoing our entire kitchen. And there is nowhere else in the house to put the washing machine. So, we now have an expensive washing machine that we cannot use. Feel completely let down by Currys PC World. All we want is for Currys PC World to take responsibility and replace it with one of the many devices that fit that space as we were reassured when we let them take away our old but functioning machine!",2019-02-01
904,5c38a0b89d378009a45b11af,"I had the worst experience - my laptop screen stopped working a week before I had to return to university very far away from the branch i went to. I asked the staff member will it be ready in a week i am going to uni so need it for then and he said yes it will take a week but will be ready. The repair in total cost me £104 - £60 for the screen repair (and then more for parts), £35 for the data transfer and £9 for the memory stick for the transfer.After getting to emails calls or texts about the status of the repair, I called customer service and after a long time on hold the conversation ended with your branch will call you. The next day with no call received i went into the branch to see what was happening. It turns out that they had not sent the laptop away, a week after they said they would, and that it would take another week to fix. I was heading to uni the next day so obviously could not have that. They also said they couldn’t ship it to the branch nearest me at uni as ‘they had lost devices in the past so it wouldn’t be safe’. They refunded me the £60 for the screen repair but not the other things (as technically they had done the data transfer) and told me to go to the uni branch and do it there. There was no compensation, no apology and no real help other than we can’t do anything. I would very much hesitate to go there again.",2019-01-11

Their helpful technical advice, ""just download the sales invoice from the internet and bring the printer back with it""....refusing to pay my taxi fare for any visit to their shop. Consumer law requires a supplier to provide an item fit for purpose, failure to provide a sales invoice does not relieve them of the requirement to provide an item fit for purpose, which they have not.

919,5c37109e9d37800a105dc5fc,"So bad was my experience with Currys, I have created this account just to leave a poor review and to hopefully make others think twice about shopping there. If there was the option of giving Currys zero stars, I would. Our fridge freezer broke three times in the first year. Each time you have to go through the performance of calling customer services (takes ages to get through, they put you on hold, often for 20-30 minutes and then disconnect you) then you have to wait for an engineer to come and diagnose the fault and then to come a repair it. Finally, after the third fault I requested a refund. After being promised a refund nothing happened and so back to customer services I went - each time being put in an endless loop of call transfers at customer services, promises of being called back which never happen and finally being hung-up on by one of their customer service employees. I can't actually believe that a company can exist with such a shocking disregard to their customers - rude delivery drivers, hopeless customer service, rude customer service and frustrating customer experience. In summary, you may save a few pounds when buying your product but I suggest you think twice. Over the past year I have had to wait in for 8 appointments (2 failed delivery and 6 engineer appointments) and literally spent hours (and hours) emailing and trying to call their customer services department, plus the cost of spoiled food each time my fridge-freezer broke. So a small initial saving has most definitely been outweighed by the inconvenience and frustrating of having to deal with Currys.

I rang in the end, only to be told that the item was not in stock and could not be delivered for another 10 days. Had I not chased it up, I would never have known that I would not have a delivery on the day I requested and paid for. I cancelled the order, yet Currys take 3-5 days to refund but take your money immediately for goods that they don't have and for a next day service they have no intention of providing.

As for the £25 paid for 'professional installation' (their words not mine) their fitter didn't bother to adjust feet to ensure machine level so I had to do it and when I checked connections after doing a trial wash found water dripping from both ends of the cold water fill hose! Luckily there is room to be able to see behind the machine to check this but for someone unable to check connections, perhaps because appliance is built in or they lack the mobility to get down on their hands and knees it could be weeks of months before they were aware with who knows what damage would have been caused to the fabric of their building! When I contacted Currys to complain and said I needed someone to sort it now I received a reply someone would get back to me within 5 days!!!!!!!! I have therefore had to contact emergency plumber to come and look at the problem and have told Currys I will be pursuing claim via small claims court to recover the £25 I paid for installation together with costs incurred to fix the problem and distress caused.Based on this experience I will NEVER buy from Currys again.

Sadly for me, I didn't shop around and what a nightmare I've had - and it's not over yet!!I had a sales advisor in the store (Bristol) who seemed nice enough. Long story short I bought a 65"" smart TV and a smaller 40"" smart TV too. The sales advisor insisted the team wouldn't be able to use my existing wall bracket, which was about 10 years old, and sold me a new one and you are also strongly advised that the best deal is to take the installation package of £199 which includes recycling your old TV's, and a 'gold' cable for faster data transfer. It's such a con.In total I spent £1,700. So I took a day off work, the men came out, BUT they only had instructions to install one freestanding TV (the smaller one) and nothing about recycling, or installing my 65"" wall TV. ""We aren't wall trained""""We aren't insured to touch your old TV's""What?So they got the small TV working and left.Then the small TV stopped working. Straight away.And I had to schedule another day off work to wait for the second team to come out to fix the TV on the wall, OH and fix the small TV. The second team told me the gold cable is a waste of time and a standard HDMI cable is all you need. Plus they were able to use my old bracket. Funny that. They also confirmed that the smaller new TV was a dud and told me to schedule a new replacement. Which I did.So I had to take another day off work today to wait for the third team to replace the second TV, which they did. But it couldn't pick up any WIFI as, apparently I bought a ""crap TV"" (their words not mine) and it doesn't pick up WIFI unless it's within 5 metres of the router. (FYI, the router is about 5 metres away). IF ONLY THE SALES PERSON HAD MENTIONED THIS WHEN I BOUGHT THE TV!!!So, today I have one TV on the wall which is working nicely thanks to the second team. And in another room, NO TV at all, despite having taken 3 days off work and paid a lot of money for the TV and non-existing installation.If only they'd get things right - How inefficient is it for THEM that they get it SO WRONG and have to send out 3 teams (oh, there'll be a 4th now to install my next, hopefully working, TV - or maybe even a 5th team!! Who knows?). I don't know how they can run a business whose comms systems fail so catastrophically; whose sales people lie unacceptably; whose products don't work; and whose customer service fails over and over again. I've not had an apology, and, despite being assured that customer services would call me to discuss compensation for days lost at work - I've heard nothing.Do not use Curry's if it's the last TV shop on the planet. Now that's a good title for my review!",2019-01-08
933,5c34cbd39d37800a105ce208,"Bought a freezer approximately 6 years ago, and took out the extended warranty.Just phones up as it has gone faulty, to be told they can get an engineer ou in ......... 6 DAYS!All the food in the fridge and freezer will be spoiled by then. Over £240 paid to Currys for an extended warranty that is next to useless - a local engineer could come out in 15 minutes, and probably repair it in 30 mins thus saving all the food.Curry's answer completely misses the point - food which could be save by prompt repairs ie within a day or two will now have to be binned - this despite paying over £200 for an extended warranty. I could get a local bloke within 24 hours, and repairs would probably cost less than the extended warranty. My advice - don't buy an extended warranty from Curry's they are a waste of time!",2019-01-09

937,5c3497ff9d37800a105cc2f4,"Should have read the reviews first, so it goes. I ordered a breadmaker which arrived at the correct time. However, the lid was damaged. Called customer services and after navigating their terrible menu finally got through to someone who arranged for the item to be collected on the next working day, with a new one to be delivered the following working day. Not sure why the exchange could not be done in one delivery as I had to take an extra day off. The collection was made ok, but with no sign of a new delivery I called customer services with the usual terrible menu and delay and eventually got someone who told me that a replacement had not been booked. I asked how long a replacement would take, he said he didn't know because the return had to be checked first, but I would be contacted at some point! I decided to cancel and buy elsewhere, and was told that a refund would be made 3-5 days after the returned item was checked. So, if it isn't, I raise a dispute with PayPal. I know that the damaged item was not the fault of the company, as the box seemed fine and was sealed, but when something goes wrong, you expect some effort to put it right from the seller. I spent nearly an hour in customer service phone queues to discover that nothing really had been done and that there is a delay in getting the refund.UPDATE: The delivery company for Currys have just attempted to re-deliver the same breadmaker they collected yesterday despite it having a returns label on it - it gets worse....UPDATE: The farce goes on - the delivery company have brought the broken breadmaker back for a second time. It still has the correct returns label on it, but will it go back to Currys? Who knows, what a completely incompetent outfit this is. Now bought the same product from AO, delivered within 24 hours and perfect. No refund so far, and no further response from Currys.",2019-01-10

My previous phone is broken and I can't spend a week with no phone for personal safety reasons. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was refused access several times. I don't dispute what I was being told is true but I wanted to make my complaint about the policy to a supervisor. Eventually the person I was speaking to said they would put me through but the line went dead and after holding for 5 minutes I gathered I was cut off so hung up and rang through again.I again got as far as being put through to make a complaint only to be cut off without speaking to anybody.I rang in a third time and just asked to arrange a return and full refund due to a faulty item and terrible customer service.,2019-01-08

942,5c33d0059d37800a105c898e,"The single worst shopping experience of my life. I ordered an Xbox OneS for my boyfriend's birthday. It arrived on time but was all downhill from there.The xbox broke almost immediately. It worked fine for the evening that it arrived and turned itself off mid gameplay the following day. We thought maybe it had overheated or something but even at the end of the day it would turn on for a few seconds and then turn itself back off never displaying anything on the screen. In response to many online suggestions, I feel the need to clarify that the HDMI was correctly connected to the correct port.This was a disappointment of course, but we figured we could easily get a replacement so we phoned their so-called ""customer service"" line where we were met with 40 minutes of being on hold, spoke to someone who transferred us somewhere else, waited ANOTHER half hour on hold, spoke to a different member of this dysfunctional customer service team. He told us he would phone us right back (not entirely sure why), which he did. I then repeated what the situation was and when the man put us on hold again to fill out details we went back on hold for ANOTHER HALF HOUR. Are you, reader, getting sick of consistently reading the word ""hold?"" If so consider it a helpful insight into how it felt as a customer being left listening to your stupid hold music for hours. When the phone got answered it was a totally different person who I AGAIN had to tell the situation to. This particular team member GUARANTEED the xbox would be picked up the following day, and the new one ""would arrive Saturday or if not Saturday then DEFINITELY Monday"".Naturally the xbox did not turn up on either of these days. When we called on Monday to check the whereabouts of the xbox we had to go through the whole process again where we were transferred from person who couldnt help to person who couldnt help until eventually we hit the jackpot and seemingly got on the phone to the one and only customer service representative who could be bothered to utter an apology for this appalling experience and seemed to genuinely want to help - though really other than the apology there was nothing she could do either except confirm that the faulty one had been received at the warehouse. We were told it would be quicker to BUY A NEW ONE WITH NEXT DAY DELIVERY and get a refund for the previous order as that would be quicker than the 3-5 day wait time for the new xbox or for the 3-5 wait time for a refund.It may come as a MASSIVE SURPRISE to you people that there is absolutely no chance of me ever purchasing from this completely defective company ever again, let alone straight away throw good money after bad. This suggestion actually would be really very funny if it wasn't so frustrating.So Currys: Where is the xbox we paid for? If you have one in stock that actually works - IDEALLY for longer than 12 hours - that would be wonderful! I know (because I asked, being desperate to give this as a now late birthday gift), that we cannot go to a physical shop to get one despite the fact that you are the same company because this would seemingly be a mild inconvenience to you. Having taken most of the hits where inconvenience is concerned, I feel compelled to at LEAST write you a review putting across how flacid your ENTIRE company is when it comes to fixing anything. Well done in exceeding expectations of just how bad buying a single electronic device can be.And now I am going to get water and paracetamol to calm the headache reliving all this has brought on.

When I was called over I showed my confirmation email of reserved item, the store assistant went off to find it and came back saying it must still be on shop floor!! This concerned me as I had gone over to check the player out and noticed they had none in stock, I told him they had none on shop floor and he muttered he meant it was being held at the back of the store, after 10 minutes waiting he slowly returned and just said ""we have sold out"".......no apology, no help in trying to remedy this just a stupid blank expression on his face, I said how is this possible when I had reserved it and had confirmation they had reserved it, he just shrugged!!! I lost my cool and said why did no one call or email me that this had happened to save me wasting my time, again no explanation, I checked my phone in front of him and saw that store still showed it in stock! He said it was the display model, so there happy for people to waste there time knowing they don't have items in stock they can sell. 2 hours of my time and 60 miles petrol wasted for nothing, cant believe this company is still operating as this happened on a previous occasion but I have them benefit of the doubt, NEVER AGAIN",2019-01-06
958,5c32277d9d37800a105be37b,"Not many qualms with this store.... I mean for teenagers and people who love technology this is one of the shops that we love.Currys is of course expensive for its quality.... but there is nothing out there which will give you the same warranty and guarantee as well as help if the device breaks. That is when i'm talking about computers. I used to have a Lenovo which had a flickering screen and I sent it to them so that they could repair. They can be a bit scuffed, a reason why I am not giving a five to this shop, as they did say it would take it a week but it took four unfortunately. It was fine as it was through the summer holidays so I knew if there was a delay then it would not be a serious problem. The screen flickering problem became an issue around 4 months after it had been returned to me so I decided to ditch the computer and get a new one. Depending on your budget which can range from £400 to £1,100 then I would look at ASUS Chromebooks (if you are looking for something cheap) and then maybe a HP or MacBook if you are going high-end.Currys has great variety and excellence for all types of electronics including fridges, gaming, work laptops, PCs as well as TVs. Their prices are a bit expensive but the rarity of you having to back with a problem is very rare. Their quality is also exceptional and even with the devices and electronics that I do buy from there I never really have an issue with the electronic.No bad issues with this shop. With a lot of space they can showcase all of their products bringing even more variety as well as customers being persuaded.Its a good shop which does not really need improvement in any area really. All they need really is a few more tills if they think of attracting more customers: I'm not sure how but there is always a way. Nothing is impossible.",2019-01-06

They arrived but the delivery people had no idea that they were meant to be installing my new cooker and taking the old one away. When telling the delivery people what I had paid for, they said. 'They were not qualified, electricians.' I spent half an hour on the phone talking to customer service sorted it out. One person was rude to me. Others were polite. In the end, I kept my fridge/fridge in which the light doesn't work. They took back the oven and said they would redeliver it on the Sunday with an electrician on board. I then re-arranged all my plans for Sunday. Sunday arrives the delivery men yet again have no idea about the installation and said they couldn't do it as there was no electrician on board. So i told them they might as well take the oven back. I return to my flat and phone customer services, at Curry's who tell me the electrician is being sent out as part of another team. By then the delivery truck has gone. Customer service then contact them to come back. They return, Finally the oven installed. Due to bad communication, it was not explained that delivery and installation are 2 separate teams of people. As for the oven, once turned on the noise is horrendously suggesting a fan fault. More like a plane taking off. I am on the phone again to Curry's team know how with an oven that's faulty and a fridge light that's broken. The light in the fridge is minor but changing it myself voids the warranty..but seriously. Exhausting and appalling. I have been promised a new oven. So in the time, i will have nothing to cook with until the mess is sorted..There was one customer service person who was very excellent in resolving the issue to book repairs in for both of my items.Not having a working oven is a massive inposition to be in. Would i shop with Currys again. NO! Noone should have to go through this. Installation of an Oven is something i can do myself. However, due to health and safety, you have to have a qualified electrician do so and they provide a certificate. I dont like to make a gripe about things. But when your parting with a lot of money, you do have a few expectations. Nightmare from the start. A new oven is being delivered on 10 Jan by them to replace the faulty oven. In reality, this should have been sorted when it was first delivered on the 2 Jan, when they couldn't install it, due to no electrician. Then i had to wait to 6 Jan for them to deliver it, and it's faulty. Obviously, when it comes to the 10 Jan another electrician will need to be on board to install the replacement oven. So that we are not back at square one. All this over an oven. I should have gone to AO.com or Argos. Its not complicated. Deliver a working oven and install it.",2019-01-07

After doing some research and watching reviews online, me and missus went off to Currys in Worthing to have a look at them in a real life. We picked one we liked and asked a customer assistant for some more details, he did not know anything about this model apart from the most basic stats, I knew more than him after watching 15 mins review on youtube, so we were handed over to the more experienced salesman. Doesn't matter, we decided to buy it, but were told, they're not in stock. Why displayed then? We were told it could be delivered on Monday to the store, so we can collect after work, fine, we would come and pick it up, so we were handed over to another assistant to complete the purchase. After putting in all the details and paying, we learnt, that our telly would not be in until Wednesday. The assistant promised to call the other store and ask if it could be delivered quicker but gave up after 15 minutes os trying to make a call. That was it, we decided to scrap the deal. He did not know how to carry out the refund and had to ask his colleague for help every 2 minutes. Total lack of technical knowledge and disregard for customers' time.

The day before I realised I had only booked and paid for one of the items to be removed so rang the help desk to see if I could add the other. After 4 long and complicated phone gymnastics I managed to talk to a human who informed me that if I changed the booking I would delay delivery by several days. I said don’t do it then. Don’t worry. 10 mins later I got a text to inform me my delivery date had changed! Distressed I rang to change it back. The people on the end of the line were intransigent and unhelpful. No apologies and refused to change. All the guys helping me install were only around that weekend so I asked for free installation which was met with arrogant disbelief!! After putting the phone down in distressed way my family suggested tying AO. I said that they could not help so quickly. I was wrong. AO was so helpful, had cheaper deals and could come in less than 2 days. Cancelled Currys. I had used them despite the reviews as they used to be good. Never again. Will always go elsewhere now.

992,5c2e607d9d37800a105aac6e,"Went to my local store looking for a new fridge freezer. Found one I liked at £399. Available in various colours. I had to leave the store as I had an appointment but I rang them later in the day, I thought I was ringing my local store but discovered later that it was head office. I asked about delivery and was told I could have delivery on 10 January, I didn’t really want to wait that long but thought I might as a liked the fridge. I asked about turning the door around and was told that should be ok, and was given a delivery price of £35. I left it as I thought I would price check with other stores. The one I found was at John Lewis, a different model with free delivery but not available for 5 weeks!! This set alarm bells ringing so I called Curry’s again, was still told I could have the fridge on 10 January, but this man thought that the door couldn’t be changed and gave me a price for delivery of £55. I mentioned this time that I really wanted the fridge in red and was told the price for this was £620!!I decided to go back to the store to check what the price was , it was still £399. So I asked about turning the door and was told that the only way to check this out was to start an order. It appeared that Curry’s didn’t have any fridges in stock, I was shown on the screen that stock going into Curry’s was between 4-10 January, but that I couldn’t have a specific delivery date until Curry’s actually had them in stock themselves. The assistant started procces an order. We went through to the stage of ticking the box for the doors to be changed then ticked the box for delivery but the assistant then couldn’t tick a box to request installation. She spoke to someone who said that was ok as they would install it anyway. In order to facilitate this the assistant typed a note asking that the fridge be put in situ upon delivery, the next bit was a delivery address etc , she then asked for my card details so that she could finish the order. At no time had she actually confirmed to me that the door could be changed but she said that as the box had been ticked it should be fine. I then said that she hadn’t asked me about which colour I wanted, she seemed pretty dumbfounded by this but did have a look at her tablet and said that it would no cost £630. I queried this dramatic price increase but she said that was how it was but should she continue with the order. I said I wanted to speak to a manager about this as I couldn’t see where the price difference came from. The manager came and looked and immediately showed me the “very” small print showing, apparently, that the price of £399 was only for the stainless steel model! I was and am outraged by this deception, the manager had obviously dealt with this issue previously and showed me more small print showing that each colourway has its own model number and therefore potentially it’s own price! Yet again Curry’s are full of very questionable tactics, different prices quoted, a delivery date given by head office that would seem to be unachievable given what I was told at my store. The tactic of “mis-selling” but putting what amounts to just a lead price is truly disgraceful. As for whether my fridge would have been installed, I am convinced that this wouldn’t have happened. As I said to the manager very time I try to deal with Curry’s it is a disaster, lies, fabrication, you name it they try it all. It’s ab time that that these shabby practices were stopped, in the meanwhile I’ve ordered from an online company, have a definite price and a free delivery. Maybe Curry’s will wake up to these issues that everyone I know always has from them, probably when they cease trading due to lack of customer confidence.",2019-01-03

First call handler wanted to refund my money very unhelpful and the phone did cut off. I called back to arrange collection and refund but the second handler was helpful arranged for knowhow and I paid 40pounds for the doors to be removed and move the fridge in. The second visit was from know how the team he said he will just remove the fridge doors but was unable to bring the fridge in as his partner has a back injury. The third delivery team came walked into my house with dirty boots measured the doors again and told me the type fridge they could not take doors off they don't come off. He started to shout at me saying we people order this things without putting them into consideration about their backs. I started crying as it was Christmas Eve and had waited all day and I was so stressed. I told him my husband was on the way. He then took the fridge out of tge garage and moved the fridge in using the last option if door I thought would be difficult. I have the recording of the third visit and how they moved the fridge in as I have cctv on my premises",2019-01-03

Fair enough.After 24 hours I contacted them to see about the delivery date, to be told that they couldn't give me one until they knew when their stock was arriving - this wasn't how it was presented on their website!In short, it took them until the 12th before they could give me a delivery date of 19th December, i.e. 16 days after paying for the item!Curry's said it was out of their hands during this process, and to contact their partners ""Team Knowhow"" who told me each time that they had no visibility of when Curry's would receive stock.The installation guys from Team Knowhow were polite enough, but installed the vent pipe so that it was blowing hot air into the wall cavity instead of outside, so had to remove it and do the install myself.Absolute farce, and will NOT be using them again for anything that requires delivery.",2019-01-03

A few minutes later I had emailed confirmation of my order and scheduled delivery/installation date, all sorted and one happy customer.WRONG!! It took them all day to decide that they wouldn't be delivering at the weekend after all. They'll be contacting me sometime in the next 21 days to let me know when it suits them instead.Not acceptable and not what I'd expect, however on reading these reviews it seems I'm not alone. Curry's used to be a whitegoods retailer you could rely on, obviously not the case any more!Update: 9/1/19 Following phonecalls and an emailed complaint the staff were still unable to provide me with a date for delivery of either the ordered washing machine or an alternative. To be fair the customer services staff were polite but their replies were nothing more than fobbing me off and telling me to ring back middle of next week when they might be able to give me a delivery date.Sorry not prepared to keep ringing them back - Order cancelled and washing machine purchased from AO.com who did have them in stock and were able to deliver. Such a shame, Curry's used to be reliable and my first choice supplier for white goods. I can accept that items may be out of stock or not available and would have purchased an alternative if the option was there, but to be mislead/fobbed off/ told to ring them back isn't acceptable and I won't ever use them again",2019-01-09

The said I could ring up in a day or two to buy the repair plan, so I bought it online. Rang up this morning to be told the repair plan doesn’t exist for this model - even though this is not made clear on the website. So I ask to be put through to someone who can cancel my order so I can get a different model that is covereed. Get put through and they go and speak to the repair plan team who say it absolutely is available with that model. So she puts me through to them. This guy didn’t even know how to work his own computer system and was getting narky with me because he didn’t know what to do!!!Anyway he changed his mind saying it wasn’t available with this product because it’s s new product - even though they’ve been selling it at least 4 weeks! So I start to complain and he changed his mind again saying that the repair plan will be available but not for several months, but he can’t actually guarantee this!!!On the phone over an hour to be told completely conflicting things and now I’m stuck not knowing if I can get my new cooker covered or if I need to cancel and get a different make/model.

In December this month it stopped working, I tried the obvious things like trying a different socket and changing the fuse, neither fixed the problem. I called the customer service line and they seemed pretty helpful, they told me that I needed to take it back into store and they would replace it. With it being December and the store not being local I only just managed to take it today, the lad took my details and found the purchase details, he said that as it was out of the warranty, there's nothing he could do. I explained that I has already called and been told it would be replaced. I asked for the managed who came and insisted that because it was out of the warranty (19days) he couldn't help me and I would need to call customer service again. So I called them back whilst in the car park and explained that I wasn't advised that I had to get it back to store in a certain time frame and when I called to say it was broke it was within warranty. They basically said the would give me some credit and then offered me £50, I had paid £79. I said that I wouldn't accept that as I was only 19days out of warranty and I had advised them it was faulty whilst in warranty, I asked James the man on the phone to if I could speak to a manager, he rudely refused and told me that they wouldn't do anymore for me and that it was my fault for not taking it into store as soon as it broke. I insisted that I wanted a manager so he put me on hold to speak to one. He came back and said the manager won't speak to you because they agree with him, I asked for the managers name and he refused to give me this. I asked why and he said he would need their permission so I asked him to go get permission. I waited on hold again and he came back and said it was Andy who was the manager and who had refused to speak to me. I then ended that call and called to speak to another advisor thinking they would be more helpful and understanding, this guy seemed more sympathetic but stuck to the same service and would only offer me £50. He kept me on hold for ages and between the 2 calls I was on the phone for over 2 hours. He promised a call from manager between 4-6 today, it's now half 6 but I already knew no one was going to call. Shocking service.

1043,5c2800579d37800b040aae4e,"Several bad experiences, most recent I wanted to buy a 240 GB SSD made by Kingston. Online it retails at around £32 - 36. Currys pc world want £59.99 for the same drive. How do they justify that type of mark up? The most rememberable is the time a friend of mine had a problem with a laptop he had bought for his daughter earlier that same year. He took it back and waited more than 3 week's for them to come back and say his daughter had spilt a fluid on to the keyboard. They stated that the laptop needed a new main board, the cost to my friend would be only £80 less than what he had paid for the laptop! He asked me to take a look. I took off the back cover of the laptop and noticed that one stick of ram was slightly skewed. I took the ram module out and reseated it. The laptop powered up and worked fine. We took the laptop back to pc world with the estimate they had given us. You can probably guess they did not want to discuss this at length with us. We had the proof, plus we had returned it the same day my friend had picked it up. The manager who dealt with us was rude and very over defensive of the department responsible for the diagnostic. He stated that they had multi million pound repair shop facilities. I informed him that it's not the amount of money they spend on repair shops but the experience of the staff is all that really mattered. Later my friend told me that his daughter had confided in him that she had dropped the laptop off her bed, and that this was the cause of the ram module getting dislodged. Do not buy from any of Currys pc world shops. They are the one of the worst retailers by far.",2018-12-29

It’s an American large style fridge but something has gone wrong with the fan. My husband recorded the noise and played it over the phone to the engineer and he knew straight away what the problem was so it must be something that’s common. They said they can’t fix it though until mid January! It makes a racket day and night so I decided to ring again today and ask for a replacement instead. We only purchased it 5 months ago so it’s still within the warranty. Anyway, I finally got through to speak to someone after waiting ages on hold, only to be told that it has to be deemed irrepairable by the engineer first before they’ll replace it! Whatever happened to good old fashioned courtesy? If you sell something faulty you should automatically get the choice to have it repaired or replaced. I’d like the latter because I’m sick of the noise it’s making and I don’t want to take the chance of it happening again and going through this whole rigmarole again! And to make it worse, when I did finally speak to someone sensible he said he was going to transfer me through to repairs to see if I could get the date moved forward and then he hung up on me!

I reserved some apple items before my holiday and paid for them once at the airport a few days later. The salesman Craig retrieved my reserved goods, which were is a sealed bag, processed the order from the face sheet and offered me free delivery to my home which I thought was fine. Upon receiving my delivery and giving the goods as a Xmas gift I realised that the Apple Watch I had purchased was completely the wrong one, I had already brought up the fact that I didn’t think the wrist band was correct but they advised that they didn’t stock the one I had originally requested. I felt miffed at this in the first instance but made allowances for the fact that the main component of the watch was still the correct one. On Christmas Day I found out that in fact the watch was completely wrong and they had sold me a generic version to the one I wanted, I requested to speak to Craig and was told that he was not available on several occasions, another staff member promised to arrange for the manager to call me back and of course he didn’t. In the end I contacted customer services who tried to fob me off again with “you have to contact the branch” I spoke to a local curry’s branch who advised me that the item I purchased could be refunded but the version I wanted would have to be sold at the till price thereby me having to forfeit the vat concession I had originally received. In the end I lost my temper and told the know how customer services member that I was fed up of being transferred from pillar to post and just wanted the watch I had original requested and was willing to pay the higher price for it. I have never experienced such appalling service and feel as though I have been sold an item under false pretences, they processed an order withour making sure the items were the correct ones, obtained my money and sent me completely the wrong one and have made me jump through hoops to correct the situation when the decent thing would have been to apologise and exchange the item for the correct one. They would not have lost out on anything as the 2 watches were identical in price but instead have taken the deceptive route and makes me almost believe they knowingly gave me the wrong watch just to make the sale, they are an utterly disgusting bunch of thieves!

After bringing my purchase to the counter, Nathan said I had qualified for a free gift.He disappeared and returned with a tv wall mount bracket for up to 23"" tv-no use then for a 43""""set. I paid the bill of £349. I registered for the promised refundm if the product sold for less than I paid. It sold for £329 onj Black Friday so I was expecting to get a refund of £20. The email I received from Currys said I qualified for a refund of £8.01.I went to check my receipt and discovered that below the tv price of £349 were the following entries:- Price promise-Currys/Pcworld website -£11.99. then LOGIK LFS16 BRACKET £11.99. thereby giving the original total of £349. The receipt was folded up and handed to me and I did not query it at the time because it was for the correct amount. So I did not get a useless ""free gift"" after all. It looks like a scam probably to get rid of redundant stock and avoid paying out on their price promise. Bad day when they cheat pensioners. Wont be using them again!",2018-12-25

1089,5c21a0fa9d37800b04088bb1,"On the 18/12/2018 I purchased a Nintendo switch off the Currys website, the website stated the item would come with next day delivery.Unfortunately it did not arrive and it is to date still not trackable. I called customer service team who were very unhelpful to say the least. I was refused a refund even though under the consumers rights act 2015 I am entitled to one, they then advised that I could go to my nearest store which is Brentford as they had called the store and arranged a collection for me. I was told the store could call them if they had any queries.This was a wasted journey as let’s call him S who I was told to speak to by two ladies (one very rude and one very confused) that he knew about it but he had no idea what I was talking about even though the ladies said that ‘he had dealt with this phone call’. Might I add that S made me wait whilst he tidied up the desk for five minuets (yes I did time it). He then called a manager who seemed very confused and had no clue what I was talking about but told me I could re purchase the item if I wanted it and then eventually once it had been investigated with Royal Mail I could get a refund. That would be a total of £579.98.I rang customer service back and spoke a very sarcastic lady, with no empathy who said once it had been investigated I could have my money back in 5-7 working days! This is unacceptable to say the least. This is not a sob story but I feel it is important you know some of my background. My son is autistic, he hasn’t seen his dad in two years this was a surprise Christmas present. This fraudulent business has truly ruined my Christmas present and what made it worse was the attitude from the staff members I can honestly say I have never had such disgusting customer service in my life.I may be one person but I will never shop with this company again and I will be sure to tell my family and friends of my experience.",2018-12-25

We ended up changing it to avoid other customers being confused. They were advertising a £400 computer at £279, only the model number on the machine was different to the price/spec ticket, a lot of disappointed people I should think and as they had sold out of that model as well, they must have known about the miss-labelling previously.They didn't have the alternative in stock either, ""left it a bit late didn't you, we have had all our stock in and sold it"", was their comment.Currys standards of service have gone through the floor since the demise of all their high street competition, the staff don't give a toss and it appears neither does the company looking at the ratings on here.

On the display model I could not find the headphone portal so I asked the sales assistant where it was. He opened a little flap on the top at the back and pointed to a small round hole, saying this is where you plug them in to. My partner asked about being able to pick up radio stations as we live in a very hilly area and the shop assistant said that it had an internal aerial and came with an antenna so we should not encounter any problems.When we got home we unpacked the unit. Read the manual on how to tune the radio in and how to play CD’s. The radio would not tune in to any radio stations and the head phones didn’t work. I then went on to the Panasonic website and looked up why the radio would not tune in and the headphones would not work. We can’t get radio stations on this unit and it didn’t matter whether I tried to tune it in manually or automatically. The shop assistant neglected to tell us or warn us that we would have to connect the unit to an external aerial to make the radio work and most annoying of all, Head phones would never work on this unit because it only has an incoming media port and no external output.

After purchasing this laptop on three occasions i have had the same problem with this purchase. On the third occasion, we had received a message to pick up our fixed laptop at 14:30 pm. We went and picked the laptop up which was supposedly fixed according to Team Knowhow. We were told that if this occurs again on the third occasion for the same problems we are eligible for a refund or replacement. Upon getting home and checking the laptop we had seen that the buttons were faulty and had fallen off. this was the third occasion this had happened. I ALSO HAVE A CUSTOMER CARE PLAN IN PLACE WHERE I PAY EXTRA TO SUPPORT ME IN SUCH TIMES WHEN I AM NOT SUPPORTED BY THE STAFF AT CURRYS. I had rung up customer services and spoke to a person called Carl at 15:30 pm after finding the fault at home then he had advised me to go back to the store and speak with a manager called Ian and they will refund or replace the product today itself. i had asked him to phone the store or drop a message on my account to say i had called regarding this third occasion issue but he did not leave any message. on his advice, I had gone into the store at 17:55 pm on the same day. An adviser of Team Knowhow called ANEIL had served me and I had explained that your adviser CARL from customer service had sent me with these instructions back to the store. He then told me that his store manager IAN was not available however he had a called another manager called LEWIS who was very rude and arrogant and said ""everything that you were told from CARL was a lie"" ""and my company is what I say"" and it will be sent back but you will have to send this product pack and then they will decide whether to give vouchers but NO REFUND! I then decided to log a complaint in store with the way thing were handled and sales adviser ANEIL put me through to customer services to log a complaint however i waited for 50 MINUTES and an adviser had said my computer has crashed and i will transfer you to another line and log the complaint down ""give me 2 minutes"". i waited on the phone in store and eventually received a message that our store is about to close and then had to terminate the call. i then went back to knowhow adviser ANEIL and told him what had happened and was not happy.I WILL NOT PURCHASE FROM CURRYS AGAIN!

1124,5c1cf7a69d37800b04073a94,"The WORST EXPERIENCE EVER with Curry's PC world .Went to the Store this year before Black Friday to buy a TV . Store manager said to buy a Virgin media as well . There was a 200£ Cashback offer if we purchase Virgin media with a TV . Thought why not , money back guaranteed and gave up Sky TV . Also , Store manager said to put a claim in for the Black Friday Cashback as well so i could have a chance to claim it back once the price goes down . Put a claim for Black Friday cashback before black friday but once the black friday was finished my TV price did not go down at all .SO money return guaranteed there . So once our broadband got installed then i tried to Claim the 200£ Cashback for the Virgin Media as well . Once claiming 200£ Cashback online ,i've got an error &sent an e-mail to the Curry's PC World Promotion Team and they are saying that in Terms& Conditions i cannot apply for two offers in one time !CYRRY'S PC WORLD MANAGER SAID TO US YOU SIGN UP FOR THESES TWO OFFERS !!!!I expressed my frustration through e-mail to the Promotion team & they said go to the store to sort it out . Went in the evening after work to the store & they are saying they cannot do nothing and we need to call to the Curry's PC world helpline . We had a big argument within the store manager that we running circles here & it needs to end somewhere - someone needs to sort it out !We had already called multiple times to the helpline etc ... Called to Curry's PC world helpline AGAIN after we left the store & they are telling me to go back to the store !!!!!!!People in Curry's PC world don;t know what they doing . Honestly there is a finish line where this needs to end and somebody needs to take responsibility !!!!!!!!We bought the Virgin media with the TV to get the 200£ Cashback & now we have been treated like stupid customers and running around and we are the customers !!!! Just unbelievable . Yes we applied for two promotions but nobody informed us . You advertise multiple promotions and do not even mention specifically your rules !!! You expect every customer to read 500 words of Terms & Conditions line every time they apply for something ?????????To sum all up , so bad customer service and no Cashback money .

1126,5c1cd1049d37800a10553358,"Please do yourselves a favour and shop anywhere other than here. After purchasing a washer dryer in Mid November 2018, I am still sat here on the 21st of December without it. After the first clown show of a delivery where the Workmen arrived with no tools or apparent savvy on how to fit the machine, they proceeded to argue in their own language in my house. This became so frustrating after they had told me it was impossible to fit the machine as they would have to remove the work surface and floor (!?) My partner had to ask them to leave and they took the machine with them. I logged a complaint and arranged re-delivery upon which a different young Man urged me to refuse delivery of the machine. This was due to the damage that had been caused to the machine by the previous delivery drivers. They had removed the transit bolts and there was a plastic grate missing from the front of the machine. He told me the absence of the transit bolts deemed the machine dangerous - It was even stated on the paperwork!!? How was an item deemed dangerous by your professionals even allowed to make it onto the van for delivery!!!? I then re-scheduled delivery yet again and the young delivery driver assured me that he would get right on to the depot and arrange for a brand new machine to arrive on my requested date (2 days later) and I would receive notification of my time slot. I received no such contact. On phoning Knowhow customer services myself I was then to be told there was no record of this delivery on the system. This was the 3rd day I had taken off work for yet another failed delivery and poor communication from Knowhow and Currys PcWorld. The level of customer service I received after making this complaint was absolutely gutter level. I was met with insolence and attitude when I questioned why for such a big company it is so difficult to provide a telephone refund rather than me having to go back to the store and request the refund myself - Another day off work and more time spent on this, 1 week before Christmas. I should probably also state that I had such faith in the company that I had agreed to a care and protection plan, that they had been debitting me for, even though I have not received the machine. Being offered £40 store vouchers compensation is NOT satisfactory. This doesn’t even cover my travel fare to work for the 3 days I took off, let alone the wages I have missed out on. I was telephoned the day after by the accounts department for the transaction of compensation agreed. So Knowhow, you can transact me for this small ammount, but you still have my money for the Washer dryer itself, the plan start up fee, 1 months payment of the plan & the installation and recycling fee? You should be bloody ashamed of yourselves.",2018-12-21
1127,5c1cb59a9d37800b0407151b,"This is my email to Currys PC World:I bought a Samsung American style fridge freezer from your Swansea Morfa store in November. When it was plumbed in it leaked badly from a faulty valve when the water dispenser was used. I immediately tried ringing customer services and have never come across a more frustrating 'helpline.' After each automated menu of choices I was faced with another menu, five or more times. Then when I finally got through all the choices I was told I would have to wait 15 minutes to speak to an operator. I tried at different times of the day over the next few days until finally I was put through to Samsung's helpline. Under consumer law my contract is with Curry's PC World, not with Samsung, and it is Curry's duty to work with the customer to address the problem, not pass the problem on. Out if frustration, and thankful to be at least speaking to someone instead of hearing automated messages, I tried to explain the problem. The Samsung operator just tried working through a checklist and seemed unable to know how to deal with a faulty brand new product. After 45 minutes of trying to explain the problem I gave up. The following day I left work early and went into the store. The store assistant told me I would need the serial number. This is irrelevant as knowing which individual item is faulty makes no difference as to how to fix or replace it, only the model is required. Nevertheless, I went home and, as Curry's will not give out its store 'phone number, the assistant later rang me for the number, promising to contact Samsung and to ring me back. I did not receive a call. After numerous more attempts to call your helpline I emailed, and received an automated message saying I would receive a response within 5 days. I again visited the store to be told the assistant I had previously dealt with had left and no one could tell if he had attempted to address the problem. I was told I had to 'phone customer services myself. As I was going abroad for a few days, I decided to wait for a response to my email. After the 5 days had elapsed I responded to the automated message to say I hadn't had the promised response. I got another automated message to this email, telling me I would have a response in 5 days After several more attempts at your helpline and an extensive search of your website to discover you do not appear to have a complaints procedure, I completed your on line feedback form. I got an automated message thanking me for my feedback. A few days later I got another message telling me that I may gave received a message telling me my email had bounced (I hadn't), assuring me it had been received and trusting that this had resolved my issue. Needless to say, it hadn't.After several more attempts at your helpline, another frustrating conversation with Samsung customer services where, after another 45 minutes of trying to explain that this was not an old product that had broken down, that there was no build up of ice because the water was turned off to prevent it leaking, and no, I was not going to lift a full sized American style fridge freezer to look underneath it, not to mention being put on hold several times while the customer services operator checked with her manager, I again gave up. After several more attempts at the helpline I spoke to someone who said she would send a Curry's engineer to check the problem before a Samsung engineer came out. I failed to understand the logic, but at least someobe was coming to look at the item.Two engineer's turned up, looked very briefly at the fridge, agreed that it was, indeed, leaking, but would do nothing because that would amount to Curry's installing the fridge freezer which would make Curry's liable for an installation fault. They told me they would report the fault and ring me immediately to let me know when a Samsung engineer would come out.I received no call so again braved the helpline. On this occasion the queue was only 6 minutes. When I finally spoke to someone, another lengthy conversation ensued, but this time he agreed to speak to Samsung himself. I stayed on hold while he did so, but it took several tries of him going back and fore to Samsung and me trying to explain that a Curry's engineer, not a Samsung engineer had visited me (It seems I was not the only one to struggle with the logic of this). Eventually Samsung agreed to send a local approved engineer. I was given the name of the local firm and a 'phone number. Now u was not dealing with eithet Curry's nor Samsung, things began to go more smoothly. The local firm rang me the next day, I explained the problem, they rang back to say they had ordered a new part and arranged for an engineer to visit me. When he arrived the part was replaced in a couple of minutes. I wasted hours and hours on the 'phone, on visits to your store, writing emails and waiting in for a futile visit from your engineer, not to mention being driven nearly to screaming pitch for a very simple repair on a brand new product. I suggest you try navigating your own helpline and fault reporting - and that you treat your customers with more respect. On past performance I will no doubt get another automated reply to this email, so I will post it where others may see it and be warned.",2018-12-21

Came back downstairs and managed to get someone only to be told that she didn’t know much about dryers!! We then asked about the free delivery which was advertised throughout the store only for the assistant to advise that it was £50 to have it delivered?!?! I explained that if I purchased the item online with curry’s I could have it delivered within 2 days free of charge! The assistant then explained that I wouldn’t get it free as it would charge me at the end of ordering online! So I had to order online standing in the middle of your store as the staff would not help! ( and yes it was free delivery) This is poor customer service! The staff were the most unprofessional and unhelpful I’ve ever came across! Not interested in anyway! Will certainly purchase items elsewhere in future.,2018-12-20

1138,5c1b89799d37800a1054a4ea,"I recently went online to see what Curry’s offered on IPads and saw that I could trade in my old, entered all the details online and was given a reference number to the value of £54 voucher to give to the store, my nearest one was Ruislip and reserved the new IPad online to collect at the same store. When I entered the store a kind man approached me and asked if he could help, I explained that I have reserved an IPad and I also had a reference to trade in my old. He then kindly starting to process the information and said I wait for someone else to approve it. After waiting for the person he said that the offer had ended, I explained that I did it online on Currys’s website. He went off to check and came back about 10mins later and did not apologise for keeping me waiting. He then started to process the transaction and asked for my email address which I declined as he had my address, mobile and I did not want to give my email (GDPR). He then said if I didn’t give an email address that he will not be able to process the transaction because the email will generate a voucher. I then asked him to use the store email and he declined. So I went away and called customer service and the lady on the phone wasn’t sure why the store couldn’t do it then went off and came back saying the only way to get the voucher would be by email. I think it’s absolutely crazy that they just can’t print off the voucher and I certainly don’t want to share all my details after the recent scandal with customers information.In the end I went back to the store and the only reason was the IPad I then purchased was £20 cheaper and that I sold my old iPad locally for £60 which was more than Currys had offered. I’ve had a few other issues with the store in question, bad customer service, staff not trained, rude, unhelpful and trying sell me warranties that I’ve said I don’t want then adding warranties without me knowing after I’ve said no. It’s such a shame that Dixon’s Group(long established)has dropped their customer satisfaction and the customer is always right approach, I’m sure Sir Stanly Kalms would not approve.

1139,5c1b88449d37800b04069643,"My partner and I recently purchased our first new fridge/freezer from Curry’s. We arranged to have our old, second hand one taken away at the same time as the new one being delivered. Upon delivery, we were told the old one was not fully defrosted, (despite it being switched off a considerable amount of time before their arrival) therefore it couldn’t be taken away. This was understandable, however, frustrating, because we had asked in store at the point of sale whether there was anything we needed to do before the new one arrived, and were told no. The old one was then left in the middle of our drive, and we had to go back to the store ourselves to organise another collection date and time for the old one to be collected. When we mentioned that no one had told us that it needed to be fully defrosted, instead of being given an apology for the miscommunication, the same woman who had sold it to us had the flippant response “of course it needs to be fully defrosted before we pick it up”. They organised for collection the next working day, and told us ""we may have to be at home to sign for the removal of the old one."" To add insult to injury, we didn’t even need to sign for the old one to be taken away in the end, so I took the second day off work unnecessarily. My advice would be to their staff to just be as informative as possible. As this was our first experience buying one, it was just a shame that something that could’ve been so easily avoided was overlooked due to the assumption that we would know this already. I ended up having to make two trips to the store and had to take two days off work. Both inconveniences could have so easily been avoided, had the correct information been communicated in the first place.",2018-12-20

1145,5c1abd9b9d37800b04065cbe,"Date of purchase 27/11/18 Item Samsung UE55NU7020 55” 4K Ultra HD HDR LED TVDate of delivery 29/11/18Where does one begin? This item was delivered as promised on 29/11/18 much earlier than the time slot given which was a plus. I bought this set for my kids as I was excited about them experiencing the 4k ultra clarity and other smart tv features. I did not get to set the TV up till 11/12/18 and we were all quite excited but our excitement soon turned to dismay when we saw a huge crack alongside the right hand side of the TV. It is only noticeable when the TV is on so no one would have seen it.From this day started our hellish experience with Currys/TeamKnowHow. I immediately called the customer services and after about 30 minutes of holding I finally spoke to someone. They agreed to an exchange for another TV. For some reason they could not schedule a delivery even though they are the same organisation. This boggles my mind till now. I was told the team that organises delivery would contact me with a new delivery date. I was not impressed as I did not see what the difficulty was.On 13/12/18 I called again to find out what day I can expect delivery. After another 30 minutes holding I spoke to a woman who told me my delivery was still pending. She tried to set a new delivery date on the system but was unable to. She reiterated the delivery team would call me to set this up. I also wrote an email to enquire about this delivery. I was told they would make contact within 4 days of setting up the exchange. I was guaranteed by Friday I would receive a call. Friday 14th no contact. Just a few automated calls asking about rating the service I had been given but I ignored these. On Saturday I called, waited for another 30 minutes on hold and was told that “definitely” someone would ring on Sunday to discuss delivery. I raised an official complaint about the lack of communication and shoddy service I had received so far. On Sunday there were no calls.On Monday 17th I received a text from TeamKnowHow saying they are delivering the TV on Tuesday 18th between 1230hrs and 1630hrs. I was excited. The slot came and passed. No comms from delivery men. I called TeamKnowHow again and after another long wait managed to speak to someone who said she would contact the deliver men to find out what the hold up was. She stated they were in transit and were due to deliver later that night. We stayed up till 2200hrs before giving up. Even the kids were disheartened as I had told them I was setting up the TV that day. There were also a few other chores I had postponed to wait for this delivery.This morning out of nowhere around 0835hrs as I did my school run I received a call from an unknown number. A man stated “were you expecting a TV?” He identified himself as being from TKH. I expected an explanation about why my delivery never arrived yesterday but no. I was pleased that at least I would get my TV today. Told him I was not home and gave him my wife's number to ring as she would receive it. He said he would call around midday. Around 1600hrs I texted her to find out if the TV had been delivered. To my astonishment it was not!! I was livid! Why did they even bother asking me for her number if they were not going to come????About 1645hrs I received a call from a man who stated he was delivering my TV. He said they were in Bexleyheath and would be with me within half an hour. I saw a missed call at around 1718hrs from the same number. At 1722hrs I received a call from an unknown number and a girl stated they had tried to deliver the TV to no avail. She said they had delivered to my payment address. Not my delivery address. I reminded her that the original order was made out to my delivery address. She stated I would have to rebook delivery or request a refund. I lost it completely at that point. Surely this was not my fault!! She said she would speak to her manager. She came back and stated she was told to tell me I would have to rebook delivery to the delivery address or get a refund. I was so angry in the end I just cut the phone on her.This in my opinion was supposed to be an easy and smooth transition but it has turned into a real nightmare. I am thoroughly disappointed with Currys as I have been a customer for many years. I do not expect such shoddy service from such a reputable organisation. Customer service needs a major improvement. One simple move would be an online chat service. Most organisations nowadays have this. It saves people from spending ages on the phone. There also needs to be a more seamless system between their departments so that everyone is on the same page. The drivers need more coaching on how to negotiate and work with customers. They should not offer time slots they cannot meet and even if they can’t make a certain time they should let the customer know!! Basic customer care. Highly lacking in this organisation at the moment. Not a happy customer at all!!",2018-12-19
1146,5c1ab79c9d37800a10546778,"Ordered several items in November. One item went 'missing' in transit, but instead of issuing an immediate refund made me wait for 2 weeks until they had completed 'investigations'. Others items were received but one item (a case of a kindle) was actually incompatible (too big) but because it was purchased as a bundle was informed all bundle items had to be returned. After protesting the agent said she we would connect me the technical knowhow team to help. When i suggested that was pointless because they physically couldn't do anything to change the size of the case, she stumbled and said she'd connect me to someone who could assist, she connected me to the technical team. To this day i am still fascinated to know how she thought they could solve the issue. After 70 minutes on the phone being pushed from pillar to post and at this point thoroughly enraged i told currys they could have the whole lot back. Nearly 4 weeks after the return i have only received a refund for 1 item, i have still yet to receive the refund for the kindle and case. Currys swear they have done a refund but no funds have appeared in my account. I have now raised a dispute via paypal so i can get my money back that way because currys clearly have no intention of trying to assist.Note this is an abridged version of events, the reality is far worse! Sticking with John Lewis and AO after this because i received a faultless service from them when i reordered via them.UPDATE is response to Currys reply. The point of my negative review has been lost clearly. I may well have been advised correctly but the way the issue was dealt with was deplorable. Why did the agent connect me to the technical knowhow team to resolve the issue of the case size? This was idiotic. Why did it take 4 different agents and over one hour to arrange the subsequent return? Why did currys not due their due diligence to ensure the case and kindle were compatible? Why now nearly at the end of December have i still NOT received my refund for the case and kindle that was returned in November forcing me to raise a dispute direct with paypal? Why have currys not responded to the complaint i raised via the agent or the subsequent email i sent?Why do currys have such poor policies? Why should a customer be made to wait to receive a refund for items missing in transit? Why, with the intelligent POS systems in use in retail these days, can't such a large merchant not refund part of a bundle - particularly when they are selling incompatible items?!",2018-12-27

1160,5c194a439d37800b0405b434,"Last week I ordered a Nintendo switch from Currys. I paid extra for a guaranteed delivery date which was last Sunday. Each day I've received a text saying that the package will be delivered and then each evening another text saying that it couldn't be delivered because I wasn't in. I have not been out of this house for three days - no-one has tried to make a delivery here. I managed to speak briefly to DPD (good luck finding a number for them too) and they admitted that they hadn't attempted delivery but 'had to put something on the system'. It happened again tonight and obviously my parcel is not going to arrive, has it even been despatched, who knows? So now I try to ring Currys, to ask for a refund (more than £300) so that I can go to a shop and buy the item for my daughter in time for Christmas. Phone answered after 15 minutes, person on the other end says,'one moment I'll put you through to our online team', another 15 mins and a guy comes on the phone, I repeat all this and he says - guess what - 'one moment I'll put you through to our online team'. That's what the last person said, I remark! Oh yes, well, there's only one number difference in our phone number, I'll pop you through.. so I'm writing this holding on and listening to their music and a voice that says occasionally 'we will be closing in 30 minutes and the current wait time is more than 15 minutes, you may need to try again tomorrow'. I will continue to hold indefinitely, until it cuts me off. What on earth do you do? Why would you buy from this shop when they take a lot of your money and then you hear nothing else from them? I know that eventually I may get my money back, but it won't be before Christmas. That's one little girl who isn't going to get her main gift from Santa.

Accidental damage occurred a few months after purchase, and I took the TV into my local Curry’s PC world to have the TV fixed under the care plan. I was told it would take up to 7 days to repair the TV. The TV arrived a week later than I was told it would take and the stand was no longer attached to the TV base, rendering the TV UN useable. I have called customer services multiple times to try and resolve this issue where I have been faced with staff members telling me different things every time I have called. I have been palmed off and passed from department to department because no one wants to deal with my issues, resulting in me to become more and more irate.I eventually had enough and called up on Saturday 15th Dec to put a complaint in where I was told I could reject the repair and have a voucher to purchase a brand new TV in my local Curry’s store. This had not been mentioned to me on any of the dozens of phone calls I had made to customer services. A collection was arranged for my TV for the 17th Dec. I called up customer services again today to ask when the vouchers would be issued to me where I was told that they had no idea when I would receive the vouchers as they department that did this was very busy. I explained I had been without a TV from the start of November and would like the issue sorted ASAP but the team member I spoke to was very un-helpful and would not ask management for advice on the situation, despite me asking him to.I have lost approx. 8 - 10 hours of my spare time on the phone to customers services on hold and being passed from department to department. -I have not had a TV since 01/11/2018.

The caller even told me I can sue them for the rest of the spoiled foods and even informed me of where I can get free legal advice - despicable way to speak to a customer to avoid paying just £70 over their formula-based “compensation” recommendation. Apparently they need “substantiation” of the goods spoiled - I said I have it in the form of photos taken of everything ruined and a list of what it all costs to replace - this is not good enough as they need receipts for proof - what do they think I’ve done? Stolen all my frozen food over the last six months? This need for receipts for frozen foods is ridiculous and is essentially calling me dishonest. Their offer of sorting this mess out on Trust Pilot is what’s dishonest. Who keeps receipts for 3-6 months for a potential new appliance failure at the six month point?!

As it was my BIRTHDAY, I had very little desire to argue with robotic customer service people. I was offered another delivery date - TODAY. And guess what. I took a day off work, waited patiently and IT WAS F...... CANCELLED AGAIN! This time none even bothered to call me and inform about it!!!So to sum up - Curries was happy to take my money and then waste 3 days of my life including my Birthday, and at the end of it, I am left frustrated with a pile of dirty laundry and no washing machine in sight. I am cancelling my order and going with a more reputable company. IF YOURE READING THIS AND CONSIDER BUYING SOMETHING WITH CURRYS - PLEASE DON'T. THEY DONT DESERVE YOUT MONEY, TIME AND ENERGY.",2018-12-18

1182,5c17a92b9d37800b0404ded9,"My partner ordered and paid for a fridge freezer on the weekend of Black Friday and arranged fro delivery to take place today, 17 December, having chosen not to pay the extortionate delivery costs over the Black Friday weekend. I took a day off work to receive the new fridge freezer and, lo and behold, we have been advised this morning that it will not be delivered today. Excellent customer service from the Team Don't KnowHow. At which point had you planned to notify my partner that the delivery was not going to happen? You sent her a text message recommending she followed the attached link to see information regarding the delivery; needless to say, she was expecting to see an approximate delivery time. I phoned the number in the website link on Sunday and, after 5 nested options, I was advised the offices were closed; excellent stuff. Why not note the opening times on the email link or advise at the start of the phone call that the offices are closed. Shining example of Team Don't KnowHow. Why are your customer service teams not phoning your customers to advise of bad news such as last minute delivery cancellations? Another customer service failure for Team Don't KnowHow. We have been offered an insulting £10 'good will gesture', despite the fact that I am now having to take a further days holiday, at a cost of £90. Oh yes, we are also advised you do not compensate for loss of earnings. Presumably, failed deliveries are standard practice as this seems to be the immediate response from your customer service teams. Everyone seems to want to blame someone else. The warehouse, the delivery team, the sales team. I was even advised to return to the store and discuss possible compensation there. REALLY?? Simple apologies do not come close to resolving this kind of issue. If I was paying for an item over 12 months and my direct debit failed I know for a fact you would not accept a simple apology from me, you would be taking (not asking for) financial recompense. I would like to know Currys proposes to resolve this appalling situation, the atrocious customer service and how you plan to refund some of the costs my partner and I have incurred. We have had to make phone calls, been kept waiting on the phone because you do not make outgoing calls and I have now had to take two days holiday to cover for the incompetence of Currys delivery teams.Even your customer survey feedback phone call was an automated service, asking just 3 questions. Needless to say you scored ZERO.It was quite obvious the customer 'service' staff don't care or, perhaps more aptly, are not allowed to care, as this will cost money and probably detract from senior staff bonuses etc. Come on Currys, drag your business out of the 1970's.I blame myself for the above as I did not listen o my partner when she suggested we go to John Lewis.

That.The in-store experience at PC World was quite simply awful. I stood by the computer I wanted to buy trying to catch an assistant's eye for about 20mins. I was joined by a couple who wanted to buy everything from a kettle to a 4k TV for their new home. Nadda. Not a hint of service. When someone did look beyond the mates he'd been chatting to for all that time, rather than come to help us himself, he stopped a passing colleague who was already serving a customer. At that point, the couple decided they'd had enough and would go to John Lewis. One of the things I need is a HDMI cable to link a tablet to a TV/screen. The assistant told me, with a look like I was fully stupid, ""most people just use Chromecast"". Sweetie, if Chromecast was what I wanted, I would have asked you for that. I asked about a promotion offering 20% off some desktops, as the machine I wanted had that sticker on it but was told the ticket included that discount. Nowhere did it say that. And when I checked competitors pricing the same unit was already 20% cheaper than PC World's price. Eh? I then asked what came in the box - the assistant didn't know and didn't know what accessories / cables I'd need to buy. So I gave up and went to John Lewis too - and within 30 mins of stepping into the store I had everything I needed. The weird thing is, don't PC World's team work on commission?

The two delivery guys brought the fridge in and were advised by our builder to pick up the fridge and put it in position (my two builders offered to pick up the fridge with the delivery guys). The delivery guys said no, and attempted to squeeze it through past our kitchen island. In the process, they scratched the island (a 40cm deep scratch) and ruined it. Plus they didn't plumb the fridge in (despite us paying for them to do so) and they also didn't attach the fridge handles. In total the damage is:- a scratched and ruined kitchen island- scratched floor tiles - the fridge is also damaged from where it scraped against the island- the plaster on the wall has also come off in part from the impact of the fridge.We are so incredibly upset and have been told by Currys we'll have to wait 5-7 days for an official reply.

After phoning and explaining the situation the customer service employee I asked for a refund, as I hadn’t recieved the product in the correct time as it was a birthday present. The employee stated I would have to exchange the headphones with the speakers to then send the speakers back to receive a refund - which could take up to 2 weeks! He also confirmed my speakers and personal details had been sent to an address in Milton Keynes. I asked what he would do about this and his reply was ‘we can’t do anything until the customer reports it’ and I said ‘I doubt they’ll do that when they’ve pocketed £90 headphones’. I also voiced my concern which was my item and personal details including my full name and address had been sent to the wrong customer and I was worried about being a victim of freud. The employee asked me for some security questions which included my email and full name (which is on my receipt of my product that’s in the hands of another person) and he then repeated back to my my email and phone number!

Then his colleague arrived, also from the staircase but with new fridge freezer on sack barrow. he left both outside my front door, I told him he would need the barrow to take old fridge away but he refused point blank to bring it in. He told me the wheels were muddy but they weren't. They decided would push old one along my hall, I refused as carpet pretty new and said if they wouldn't use the wheels they'd have to carry it which they did. They managed to knock a picture off the wall and bang into a radiator. They moaned about a bookcase in the hall but I'd measured previously and knew there was plenty of room for them to pass which they did easily. Brought new fridge in and dumped it in the space then asked me to sign paperwork. I said he was supposed to unpack new appliance, place in position and take packaging away which I'd paid for, he said was not unpacking it as if he damaged it would have to pay for a replacement. He said not employed by Currys they are a courier company brought in to help with deliveries. They were rude, ignorant, unprofessional, unhelpful and unfriendly. I rang Currys who refunded the £20 recycling fee immediately. I emailed over a week ago about the service I received but I've heard nothing and this is why I've left this review as I wasn't going to.

Not sure to laugh or cry...taken 2 days off work for this product and have to take another day off for 4th attempt of delivery. Incompetent, inefficient, inadequate, inconvenient! By the sound and attitude of their employees on phone it’s an often issue that customers come to face. No satisfactory explanation or resolution but leave you with no option but to wait another few days for delivery resulting more loss on income to customer. Asked to speak to Manager and they’re not interested to listen to customers. Rather a message from them that they’ll call you back. Couldn’t care less approach from them.",2018-12-15

1213,5c14a9409d37800a1051f1b1,"I bought a Fitbit Charge 3 at Currys which records steps and flights of stairs when I'm on my motorbike making it utterly useless.I live in France but bought it in the UK so as soon as I realised it needed to go back, I got on the phone. This is where Currys falls over - BIG TIME. Huge wait to be told I was talking to technical and needed to talk to retail so another huge wait followed by a dropped call.So I figured I'd try CAMI, their Chat Bot. What a farce that thing is. Currys should scrap it immediately. Judging by the comments there, all it does is drive people to even higher levels of anger.Anyway, eventually I got hold of a real human via messenger. OK, it took 24 hours to respond but to be fair it does actually say that's the response time.Currys have offered me a voucher for the full amount and don't even want the Fitbit back which I think says a lot about the quality of this product. Perhaps they should take it off their shelves altogether?So. Currys are Bloody hard to get hold of but once you do get through to a human, my experience is that they do the right thing. It's just frustrating getting to that human contact.UPDATE.Went into Currys Cribbs Causeway branch in Bristol over Xmas and they were great. Great advice in deciding what to get to replace the useless Fitbit (Don't buy one folks, they're rubbish). The voucher code worked flawlessly and it was a thoroughly pleasant experience.So.... If you need assistance, it seems you need to go to a store or use Messenger (with the 24 hr delay)",2018-12-27

I was surprised as two split parcels were sent but only received email confirmation for the controller. Basically someone stole it. I have been waiting for them to deal with each other between Currys and DPD no one wants to contact each other. Currys waiting for DPD. DPD sent email asking me to tell Currys to give them a call. What a joke. I have been chasing them all this time of 2 weeks. I so regret didn't pay only £4 extra to get next day delivery just because at that time I was waiting for driving kit anyway. This is something to do with them party not customer. It is not the case of me returned and lost in transit. I never get to touch it yet. I think someone in the warehouse stole it. I don't even think DPD actually received the parcel but only scan the code!! Otherwise I would receive confirmation from Currys about the xbox. Why would I have to wait for investigation like it is my fault. First I called up they said a new one would be sent straight away. I waited for nothing as that person lied to me. I called again after 3 days of no email confirmation of sending off the new one. Then they changed the story to it needed to be investigated. This is unbelievable!! Now I'm asking if I can cancel they said I can't I asked if I could exchange because I was waiting for so long and 3 year cover price also £30 more which is not right. They said ok. We gone through with transaction and courtesy of certain discount. Paul, the sell staff is absolutely helpful promised it will be sent next day delivery which mean Saturday 15th. I was absolutely happy and excited. Then my world is tumbling down as 30 mins later they sent email cancelled the order. When I called up they said it security reason. REALLY!! I FEEL LIKE THEY ARE TREATING ME LIKE I AM COMMITTING FRAUD. Basically they think I have a case open of have not received the product then dare to order a new one. I just don't believe how they treat customer. I have been patient with them I gave them chance. They can see anyway that the item end somewhere in DPD warehouse or might never even reached there. Why is this my fault. It is not the case of me returned the product then got lost!! I still have to wait until 17th December as they has been saying this for 2weeks to get the result from DPD.

Delivery was delayed so I rescheduled it, asking for item to be retrieved by me at a pick-up location. After receiving a 'ready to be picked-up' notification and arriving at the pick-up location, I was told that the item has been recalled by the seller (Currys PC World). I spent over 30 mins on the phone to customer support, who acknowledged that the error was on their side. I was also informed that a full refund would reach my account in approx 7 calendar days. As no refund had been issued after 7 days, I phoned customer support again, this time spending approx 40 mintues on the phone. I was told that the item had been received and that a refund would be processes within - again - approx 7 calendar days. After another 7 days no refund had still been processed and I made yet another call, lasting for over 30 minutes, in which I have been told that the refund would now be processed that very same day and to expect a confirmation e-mail by noon. No confirmation e-mail was sent to me within the next 24 hours, which led me to phone the customer service yet again and after speaking to a representative for another 20 minutes, I was told that process to issue the refund had not completed correctly, so no refund had been issued. I was then (finally) sent an e-mail confirming that a refund would be processed. At the time of writing, I am still waiting for the refund to reach my account. So far the process - from the time of placing the order - has taken almost 3 (three) weeks.Summary: an error on the seller's side, which has been acknowledge by the seller. Errors happen.

The cooker was faulty from day one, everytime I used the top oven it blew all my electrics. It took 50 minutes to get through to customer service who then redirected my call to team knowhow, an answerphone service which cut me off before I could leave my name or number. Another long call to customer service ensued and a very helpful Oliver arranged a repair for me. On Dec 6th an engineer duly arrived, he found a fault with the element which he replaced. Same day while cooking supper electrics blew again. Another lengthy call to customer service who decided I should have a new cooker. Yesterday, 12th dec, the cooker arrived. Unfortunately the 2 delivery men were not cooker trained and could neither disconnect my old cooker nor install the new one, a service I had paid £75 pounds for so they ended up taking the new cooker away with them telling me to contact customer service yet again. Another call this time I spoke to Hamza who couldn't help at that time because the delivery had not been updated on the system, he promised to ring me back before the end of the day, he did not.so here I am still stuck with a cooker I can't use. I have used currys many times in the past but I certainly won't in the future. The customer service is an utter shambles. If I could give no stars, I would. I don't necessarily blame the customer service staff who have all been polite, it's the communication between customer service and team knowhow that needs a complete overall.I am now updating my review.

Your poor shop managers who I will leave nameless have done a really good job in sorting problems, your customer service are...let me see if I can find a word...PANTS! (and that is extremely polite). I suggest changing your business ethics or expect a massive fall in revenue when people realise somebody else is better.",2018-12-12

1249,5c110b719d37800ac09ef643,"I bought laptop on Black Friday deal in Brixton store. They did not have my color in stock, the said it will arrive in about 3-5 days, I said no problem, I will come back and pick it up. They also signed me up for a warranty which they said will start when I pick up the laptop.I went back 8 days later, still no laptop in store. No message sent to me beforehand not to waste 2 hours of my time to take special trip to the store. The customer service assistant called a store in Fulham and said I can go and pick it up from there as i didn't want to spend another two hours going to this store. I went to Fulham store two days later, they would not give me the laptop as apparently there was not email request stent from Brixton.I called customer service in Currys to arrange a delivery of the product to my home as I did not have another two hours to go to Brixton. I had to speak to two people, one didn't even hear my whole story and simply put me through to Brixton store without asking what I want... The second lady I spoke to was amazing and chased up with Brixton, and sent them an email. The manager from Brixton called, and said they can't send me the product and the only way to get it is to pick it up. I could not even cancel it by this point as all Black friday deals were over and I needed a new laptop for work urgently. The manager said he will give me £20 off another product purchased in store as a goodwill for the troubles. Quote: for example if the computer bag is £25 you might be able to have it for £5'. I went to the shop (this was two weeks after my original purchase). The shop has very limited stock and not a very good choice but I managed to find something I would make use of. I take two products to the manager, one is a mouse, price £15. He says, so I can give you £5, off. I look at him in disbelief. And then say really, you said you will give me £20 discount. He then says, ok I can give it to you half price... after further negotiation he says ok, I will give you £10 off. I mean, why am I being made look cheap and negotiate for something he said he would give me? then there was another product as naturally I wanted my credit back, at least something for all the time and money spent (in total 5 hours travelling and 45 mins on the phone and £10 travelling to the stores three times). I mean, half of working day is 4 hrs, who is going to give me my time back? Anyway, of the second product, which was a computer sleeve he said he will give me £5 discount. By this time I was over Curry's. I took it and left. I used to buy all my electronics there, and my mobiles. The last time I bought my mobile I had a poor customer service. After this time I am not going back to Curry's again.",2018-12-12

I contacted customer service via email and attached a copy of the E-Receipt. I got an automated email stating they would get back to me within 5 working days (this email was sent on a Friday). Come the following week, id still had no email, so I opted to forward the email to Skull Candy directly on the off chance they would assist. Thank god I did!! They came back to me efficiently within 48 hours and were in constant contact. By the following Thursday they had sent me an E-Voucher worth £50 so I could order a new pair on their website direct with 2 years warranty. Its been delivered already. Fantastic. In the meantime, Currys, laughably, have emailed to say ""we hope everything got resolved after contacting us"". HAHAHA. You couldnt make it up. I had no email from them, no phone call, absolutely nothing. This has to be the worst service I have had. Thankfully I have a new pair of headphones courtesy of Skull Candy. My advice is very clear - DO NOT USE CURRYS. You will be out of pocket and will have the worst back end customer service in the UK. My father in law ordered a new TV and Cabinet - they delivered the TV and not the stand - they told him to pop into the store in a weeks time and order a new one.

Another £120 wasted as they are just as bad, one is so slow and the other you have to fire up twice before you can use them. All they are interested in is money not concerned with customer care in the least. I think they use secondhand returned items they know are faulty and sell them as new in their sale.

The invoice said it can be returned to a store for a refund with the card used to pay with. The Blackpole store in Worcester said it couldn't and refused to refund, stating it had to be posted back which they would do via DPD. So they are blatantly advertising wrong terms. They gave no receipt or anything to say we had returned it, we had to make the shop assistant sign an invoice so we had some sort of proof it was returned to the store. It sat in the store for 2 days before DPD collected and returned it on 29th Nov.

Called again on 10th and still no changes, not confirmed receipt of the console even though we have proof from DPD it was delivered.

It's just absurd...these people are cowboys, do not give them your money, potentially you'll have nothing in return.",2018-12-10

1285,5c0d773d9d37800a688303c6,"DO NOT ORDER FOR XMASYou cannot trust anything will arrive. I ordered a piece of hardware yesterday and paid extra for 1 day delivery to guarantee it gets in. Got confirmation emails- great. Night time on delivery day, nothing.Called customer service- first of all used the menu system re: order not arrived and a heartless robot said 'check our website' and hung up. Maybe I already had and that didn't work?Second try, I did the old- don't press anything routine and got through to a human after a 27 minute wait. She could not have cared less.First off she said it was out of stock, (no email sent to tell me this, the website allowed me to order it- I even got 2 confirmation emails). She told me that maybe 10 people had ordered concurrently and only 5 were in stock so only 5 could be fulfilled. This isn't how databases work in 2018- it just isn't possible unless they have the wrong stock figures input or have some horrific manual backend- I think this was a lie.Then I asked for a refund, I had to pay upfront and immediately, so I expect my money back in the same fashion; that's fair, right? I paid via Paypal- ZERO time to clear the payment and refunds can be handled instantly if the company you are dealing with care to do so. Obviously the customer service representative told me that my payment would take 3-5 days to clear to them and so my refund would take a further 3-5 days to clear. Absolutely untrue, confirmed lie.I demanded to speak to a manager, who wasn't available of course. So money is being claimed back via paypal.The very same product is still being sold by Currys PC world on their Ebay sales channel as 'in stock' and delivery by 12th December- but we now know anyone who orders won't receive one and likely won't be informed that it isn't on its way. How many upset kids will there be this Christmas because this retail behemoth is failing at every level?About every year I forget that Currys PC-World sell general insurance, not products and give them a chance and for the last 3 years each time they have royally screwed up.

We wanted them fitted before we moved in so we picked the Wednesday day before we moved in and we came to the house to wait for them to be delivered and installed and we got a call on the day to say they wouldn’t be delivered due to a sickness so we picked another day which was the Saturday. We tried to track our delivery on the day and it still said Saturday with no time so we called customer services and we were told our appliances were out for delivery but someone would phone to tell us a time. We hadn’t heard from them so tracked it again and it said they would be delivered on Thursday which we weren’t notified about no phone call, email nothing. We called them again and they couldn’t tell us why they weren’t getting delivered there was no notes? The girl said she would phone the depot to find out she said our items were there but wouldn’t be delivered and again no reason why? tbh she didn’t have a clue what she was talking about and had a very bad attitude we also asked for a call back from a manager and she left us on hold for 20 mins and came back and said she would get a call back but it’s not going to change the fact we’re not getting our appliances. 2 hours later no call back from a manager so we called again and the girl we spoken to told us that there was no call back for a manger wasn’t logged. We finally got a call back from a manger and again we didn’t get anywhere she said we could get 40 pounds back for compensation? But they doesn’t cut it, I took 2 days off work unpaid.

May I say that it hasn't got any better. After being told that my cooker wasn't delivered because it was still in the warehouse, then it was out of stock. I still don't know why I never received it. However, Currys have not helped in any way. They are rude when you phone, email you, then don't bother to answer when you reply. After all this time, since 6th November they will not refund my son the money he paid out or even offered an apology. I have sent back emails with my mobile number and asking they phone me to get this sorted but I've heard nothing. I am very angry at the way we have been treated by this company and their customer services is absolutely abysmal. I feel the next step is to get in touch with their head office as no-one else seems to know what to do. All I ever wanted was an answer to my question, why didn't I get my cooker? I will never ever go to currys again because of their appalling treatment to customers. If anyone has suffered in the same way perhaps they could tell me if it was resolved.",2018-12-09

Two calls of 40 minutes and 35 minutes later and no oven installation had been booked for Sunday 9th. It had been booked for December 13th. First time I'd heard of it.

1316,5c0a73879d37800a6881fbd0,"Simply appalling overall service and a company I shall never, never, ever give my money to again.I online ordered a Kenwood chest freezer for delivery 2 December- the delivery team were two scruffy males in an unsignwritten van who showed up and put the freezer in my ground level garageI had paid for package disposal and to recycle my old freezer - the deliverers were reluctant to remove the packaging but did so when I insisted but declined to take away the old freezer as ""we have a full load on the van but someone will take it away next day"" Only after they had departed did I discover that one corner of the lid had suffered damage and been crumpled.That's when my troubles really began: -First an attempt to call Currys by phone- their recorded message was ""we are very busy and it will take more than x number of minutes to answer- I hung on for 22 minutes and then gave up.So, I tried to contact the company via its 'Contact Us' web page but that failed and it transpired that their systems were malfunctioning (and still seem to be some 5 days later as I still cannot login) so I emailed a detailed report as above to Customer Services, which resulted in a response from Currys Customer Services from their Teamknowhow.com, address, giving me a case reference number and telling me how important my email was and that it could take up to 5 days to receive a response- I tried phoning every day since, 22 minutes each day before giving up (only 15 minutes today(Friday) and finally spoke to someone!) and emailed Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, with similar responses from Teamknowhow.Finally I spoke to someone today who has booked a new machine and removal of the old appliance- the lad who dealt with me, although civil, didn't have any empathy with my situation and refused to accept that I had had my time wasted this past week and refused my demand for compensation which I pitched at £50 for starters - ""that won't happen the best we can offer is £15 "" - a polite two fingers to me, in my opinion; that offer is exactly what Kenwood had already offered having independently agreed to write the damaged unit off and replace it- so Currys were actually escaping scot free for their appalling service and the stress caused, not least of which has been having to manage without a freezer since last Sunday 2 December- until 9 December when the replacement is due to arrive.As a final note I also expressed astonishment that although I had received an email response on 2 December from Teamknowhow that my message had been received and a case number reference given to me and that a reply would be made within 5 days, that I had today received an email from Postmaster at Dixonsretail at onmicrosoft.com informing me that my original email of 2 December had been actively refused by the recipients server. I was then asked to whom I had directed my email and I replied- I was then told it should have been to their .co.uk , address and not to their .com, address and that's why it hadn't been delivered/responded - as if I had somehow dreamed up their address and chosen incorrectly and therefore my fault.Actually I had sent it correctly to their .co.uk, address but had received the Teamknowhow response from their .com address with assurances and case reference as aboveThank you Ian but I’ve spent quite enough time on this matter already and my review was a complaint not a plea for help, since it is far too late for that Also, you should be aware from my post that your Teamknowhow colleagues have everything they need plus this post to improve your dysfunctional Customer Services; for your reference the delivery number was 7426316241 and later confirmation of replacement delivery/ collection (recycle appliance overlooked)CUR1857075140",2018-12-17

1320,5c0993d39d378005d41929c3,"I ordered a fridge/ freezer and also a washer/ dryer a month in advance for our new house. We received a delivery a slot the night before which was 10:25-14:25. Trying to plan ahead and be organised I also booked a food shopping delivery to come later that evening. At 14:35 I realised the time and recognised that the delivery was late, therefore I called the customer service contact number. After waiting for 45 mins to speak to someone the lady I spoke to said that she had contacted the driver and the delivery would be in the next hour and half. Two hours went by and still no sign of a delivery, so I called customer services again. The lady I spoke to after waiting 30 minutes said that she couldn’t get into contact with the driver but the delivery ‘should’ still be made. Then, 19:00 came round and we still hadn’t received the delivery. Once again I contacted customer services, I was on hold for 40 minutes and the man on the phone could not help me with my enquires. He wasn’t able to tell me where my order was, when it could be delivered on another day. I then asked to speak to a manger and I got told that I couldn’t and would have to wait till tomorrow. After a very long and painful phone call I decided to cancel my order completely and get a full refund. The man told me that I would receive an email confirming the cancellation and refund .. I haven’t yet received this. The management team is due to contact me tomorrow at 12:00pm. Hopefully they call on time and can deal with my complaint. I made it very clear that I was not happy to all of the customer care team and I did not get a good enough response, if any response at all. The customer care was awful and the whole situation was disappointing and ridiculous. I will not be using Curry’s again and will not be recommending them to anyone. I now have a kitchen full of food that needs to be thrown away because I haven’t got a fridge to keep it in. I have spent money on three phone calls, extra money for dinner too and wasted money on a food shop. DO NOT ORDER ONLINE WITH CURRYS!",2018-12-06

I was told that the shop can not accept the return of Microsoft Office I had to return I by post. When I telephoned Currys (25min wait) I was told that I could not use the returns label supplied with the product they would email me one and I had three options a collection at their availability, return to Matalan or Curry's store all a considerable distance away , I don't drive.

He then put me through to customer services and after a 45 minute wait on hold spoke to someone else. He told me stock was due in 5/12 and that i would get my delivery 6/12.

However when I rang they said they still hadn't ordered enough Tv's for the orders they had received - yet they still have our money!

1328,5c091df89d37800a688170aa,"No answer from management, so here's my review as a now ex-customer.My shopping experience today at Currys Canterbury.I want that specific TV in store, and it's going to be a Christmas present. Salesman goes at the back to get it and comes back a few minutes later.He kind of carries the TV around with two fingers around a hole that's falling apart (instead of carrying it safely and properly), then slams the TV on the till desk, corner first.That's when I tell him I am opening it to check the state of it before buying.He then starts arguing with me about it, so I had to tell him that's that or I am not buying. He carries on moaning about it, arguing that the TVs get roughed up around all the time like he does, and that the boxes are designed to be treated like that..What a terrible thing to say. I'm not buying a box, I am buying the TV inside the box.So I keep on repeating that I am opening it, until he lets me open it. He goes on to question me,""Do you know what a salesman job is all about?"" He says.""TVs do arrive in boxes and get shifted all day that way"". He says.As it turns out, I was doing his job 20 years ago. I never roughed up the stock, I never argued with customers in such a petty way. I certainly never dared to speak to a customer like that.Pro tip, do not rough the stock up in front of the customer, for obvious reasons.Pro tip 2, do not underestimate the customer's knowledge, and work experience. I fully know TVs are wrapped around pallets and should be treated as carefully as possible. Not tossed around like he does as a habit, and boasts about it on top of it all.I bought the TV in the end, but I want you to be sure that any problem and I will be back for a refund. In the meanwhile, and all things considered:If that's the way you train your staff, then I'm not a customer any longer. Not the first time I have problems with Currys / PC World, including other instances of staff lying to me on multiple accounts, so that's very likely to be the last.What a very, very unpleasant customer experience, and all the people around us seeing all of what went on looked more horrified than me. Some of them actually told me to not buy it, and quite frankly , I borderline walking out and leaving the guy where he was. Back home, I had to double check that I wasn't going to give a broken Christmas present.Cheerio, and keep up the bad work. I see how PC world went down and ended up in a merger. Carry on messing around with your customers like that long enough and next time you'll merge with bankruptcy. I'll know better next time.",2018-12-06

I got a confirmation email from Curry's along with a text indicating that my delivery will arrive on Monday. So I arranged to take a day off and wait for the delivery that came on Monday as it was scheduled. However, the crew who brought my order just dropped off the washing machine without taking the old one and without installing the new one. I tried to show them the confirmation email from Curry's however they replied ""I don't give a s***, I only do what I see on my papers. If you want the machine installed you will need to pay us extra"". I asked them to call the warehouse and check but they ignored me and left. They were behaving more like crooks and less like Curry's employees. On Monday evening I called Curry's and told them what happened, and they arranged for someone and come over on Wednesday and make the installation along with taking back the old device. On Tuesday I got a text saying that someone will come between 7 am to 11 am, so I took another day off and waited. No one showed up till noon, so I called to Curry's again and someone from the support team told me that there is no specific slot arranged but someone will come up shortly. So I kept waiting till 5, and obviously no one showed up. So I called again the support team and someone told me they are trying to reach the crew, but in any case they will be with me shortly today. I replied that the same thing was mentioned on an earlier call, and how is it possible not to be able to track people who curries a mobile with them. Obviously no one showed up and I decided to cancel my order.",2018-12-06

Next day still nothing, so called (25mins) to be told not in stock and no date for when back in stock so cancelled order. Refund expected 3-5 days.

He asked how much was on the cards and I said £158 on one and £85 on the other to which he Said “I need to know the exact amount to the penny!!!”I then told him the full exact amounts £158 on one and £85.38 on the other and he started to process what I wanted. During serving me he had three different conversations with three different work colleagues which in itself is rude. He then mumbled “so £85....” and I couldnt hear the pence that he said so I repeated £85.38 He then replied “What did I say then?” With an attitude like How Dare I doubt him. I said “sorry I couldn’t hear you and you have had three different conversations with three different people since I told you the figure so just wanted to check “He then proceeded to put the first One for All gift card through but failed to then change the second card to a love 2 shop card. He kept it as a one for all card even though he had both of them and could clearly see they were different As a result of this the love to shop card declined (as he’d put it through as a one for all one so when I swiped the love to shop it automatically declined)Both transactions then aborted and reversed which meant the £85.38 was refunded back to my one for all card. My balance however was showing as zero as it takes a few days He then had to call a manager down who eventually sorted the issue out but only by keeping my one for all card.I explained that if it was one that my works were going to top up each time that I’d have an issue but as the refund was in transit - she had no choice but to retain my card and sort the refund out using a store one for all card. I will check with my head office if I need the card on an ongoing basis and if I doWill need it returnedThis whole experience was a mess. Joshs attitude and the time it took to purchase a gift card!Even when the manager came to sort it out Josh just implied the systems stopped working and failed to mention that he had put the second card through incorrectly potentially causing the entire transaction to fail. When I told the manager the entire details he then said “that’s not what happened” to which I said it was and reminded him I was the customer!!! It should also be noted that there was a guy called James behind the counter too and he was in training and I was utterly horrified at his attitude too. A customer came in to collect an item she had reserved and after ten minutes of searching for it behind the counter Josh told James (whilst serving me still) that he had to go and get the item (from wherever your reserve and collect items go to)James then huffed like a teenager and said “I have to go an get it?” All of this took place in front of the paying customer.I guess if he’s learning from Josh then maybe that’s where the bad attitude is coming from but as someone that has clearly only just started working with you - something is going horribly wrong If that’s the attitude of a new starter.If one of my team behaved like that in front of a customer the way James did or spoke to me the way Josh spoke to me, then I’d seriously be questioning what customer service training is taking place in branchAnd whether they were in fact right for a customer facing role in my company",2018-12-04

He told me that Dysons are a trustworthy brand and it would last at least 20 years and the VAX would only last me 6 months. I asked him about the other brands and he said you get what you pay for. I then asked about the Sharks as they looked pretty expensive. He said that they were also rubbish and just priced more expensive to seem as though they are good but were just as bad as the vax if not worse. I was confused with all this information therefore decided to not buy a vac. I came home and looked on Amazon and Argos and found the reviews customer left after purchasing vacs helpful.

These people never wanted to remove or connect these machines even though all was fully paid for. Currys delivery service stinks. Currys did refund delivery costs.,2018-12-01

I was shocked to realise it did not have this function.When I was in the store it was repeated to the member of staff that this was one of the main functions I wanted it to have.I went back to the store the following week and spoke with a store worker and let them know I had purchased the TV which didn't have the function I requested. To that I was then told because it had been opened I could not return it, or exchange it.The TV was mis sold to me as I chose it on the advice of the employee of Currys. When asking to have it returned the staff just laughed at me and said they can't do anything. I was so shocked to be treated like this as a customer.

The Your Plan thing doesn't work, it constantly redirects me to blank pages and changes my items. I went in store and they tried to help but I was just bounced from department to department as no one knew what to do. I went to the Canterbury branch and a young woman called Shannon actually stopped and listened to me and went through the process with me and even she couldn't understand why the system was failing Other than her no one in the company cares that your system isn't working and I can't purchase my goods so I've gone and taken my £1254 elsewhere. Shannon is the only person who made me feel like my custom and time was wanted. i won't be recommending PC world anymore as no one cares that we had an issue and no one wanted our £1000+ enough to try and help except Shannon.

1393,5c02c1ba9d378000988446a7,"We ordered a camera in Currys Black Friday sale. The courier sending the camera lost it, which we weren't told until we chased it up. After several days and phone calls, we were told nothing could be done until they had completed their internal investigation. As in, they had all £500 of our money, and we had nothing. After being given a timeline as to when this would be completed, we had still heard nothing until we phoned again. No camera, no money and no complete investigation. When a refund was asked for, we were told it would take five working days for it to be processed. At time of writing we have received neither camera nor refund. Frankly even if they gave us the money back AND the camera, we'd still never use them again.EDIT 4.12.18: After two more promises of returned calls that didn't materialise, we requested a refund that was processed without so much as an apology. The next day, we had an apologetic but all-too-late phone call from a manager who said that EVERY SINGLE time we called (approx 7/8 times) it should have been escalated and never was. We were told the investigation was due to the fact that their click and collect delivery is subject to the same conditions of their home delivery. In other words, they investigate in exactly the same way as if we'd said it had not been delivered to our house, even though there was no possible way we could ever have been in contact with the camera as it was being delivered to a store when it went missing with the courier. Overall, we ended up with our money back, no camera and several wasted hours of stress. They'll never have our custom again, that's for sure.",2018-12-04

They said they couldn't replace the headphones in store because I bought them online. I complained and they then changed their mind and said they could replace them but the warranty would end. Very annoying but I agreed. Then they tell me THERE AREN'T EVEN ANY HEADPHONES IN STOCK. I then have to call up to sort this out over the phone. I was transferred from one department to the next ABOUT AN HOUR. NO ONE EVEN KNEW THE PROCESS FOR RETURNING THE HEADPHONES. I finally spoke to someone who gave me a pre paid postage stamp to send them back and then they would send out a replacement. Curry's now have the headphones, so I called up to sort out the replacement as I now have no faith they would do it on their own. I was told they couldn't do it AND I NEED TO GO IN STORE. This honestly has to be a joke. They said they were going to send the broken headphones back to me! I refused to do this because it's an absolute waste of my time.

I received it promptly enough, however the laptop had a faulty screen. When I tried to register the laptop with Dell for it's warranty I discovered that it's serial number had already been registered by someone else. I strongly suspect that the laptop had already been returned by someone else with the same fault. This is a £1600 laptop that I bought as ""brand new"".After about three hours on the phone being transferred around the houses I eventually made arrangements to return it at my local store. According to the tracking number, DPD delivered my returned laptop to Currys on Wednesday 28th November. I rang through today to check what happens next and was told that due to all the returns from Black Friday it will take until this time next week for them to check the laptop back into their warehouse and a further 3-5 days after that for my refund. For a company that can take a payment and have a product delivered to you within 24 hours, why is it so slow the other way around? I am now without a laptop on which to study. I can't get over the cheek of having received a product that had clearly already been through this process with someone else, Currys will probably keep sending it out in the hope that someone will just accept a faulty product!

No response just eye contact and silence so I started my question and was briskly told they were already serving someone. Couldnt I see that. They both looked like salesmen to me but apparently one of them was a customer. Both had logo clothes on. I’m old and I just thought it could have been handled more gently and kindly.,2018-11-29

1431,5bfffcea9d37800a687db83b,"We ordered a Rangemaster Kitchener 90 from Currys PC World during Black Friday sales week and were excited to have it delivered on the Sunday.The Rangemaster arrived damaged, with the main oven door making a terrible banging noise which the Know How/Rangemaster (it could be anyone to be honest as they are totally unbranded) installers acknowledged immediately. After they left and we got a good look at it we noticed damage to the hob with pitted screws, damage around the area where screws are placed, damage to the edge of the hob area between the control panel and the main hob and pitting around the hob plates.It’s clear that this very expensive cooker has been dropped and damaged before it had left the warehouse and maybe more so en-route to us.After speaking with Rangemaster customer services which took 2 attempts to speak to a coherent person, we were offered the chance to reject the item or have a replacement.We were advised to use the cooker until replaced. On second use, we heard a big popping noise followed by a loud bang which led to the electricity being tripped and the main oven inoperable.Subsequently, we used the grill given the oven was out of action and after about 10 minutes smoke starting billowing out of the back of the cooker (we hadn’t burned the food!) and so we had to switch the cooker off. I am fully expecting to find damage to our electrics when we eventually remove this.We had done a lot of research on the Rangemaster before buying and loved the look of it. We initially opted for replacement after eventually speaking to Rangemaster customer support but now need to have it collected, taken away and refunded given the problems encountered.But guess what! No-one at Curry’s wants to take responsibility (or answer the phone). Rangemaster have gone to ground and not responded to our email so we are left with a lemon of a cooker that we urgently need to have collected in order to replace before Christmas.We should have kept our old Hotpoint Range cooker. It may have been 9 years old but worked!",2018-11-29
1432,5bfffb899d378000988322cc,"Sorry for the long review but it covers 2 problems.I've used this company a few times over the years without needing any after sales service until my last purchase which was a laptop from their Lincoln branch. After a couple of weeks I had a bit of a problem with one of the keys having a delay in typing, not being very computer savvy I took the laptop back to Curry's. After waiting on the counter a while one of the staff, who I assume was a supervisor, shouted a young man who was chatting with others in an office to come and see to me, after rattling his fingers over the keyboard he said nothing he could do he could send it away but as I hadn't bought Curry's extra Warranty there would be a charge of £50, I explained the machine was only a couple of weeks old but was told it made no difference. He was very offhand and almost aggressive in his attitude, so much so that the supervisor came across and told him to get back in the office and he would sort it out, I was surprised when he said that's the third time I've had to tell him today. The laptop was sorted out but to add insult to injury a year later I was charged £30 through the bank by Currys for something I knew nothing about, I contacted the bank and they looked into it they came back saying the charge was a service I had signed up for when buying the laptop and they couldn't help so the charge was correct, I asked for proof of this and they sent me Curry Explanation. Without going into details it was totally untrue and was very easy for me to prove it was nonsense, as a result Currys cancelled the payment and with the help of the Ombudsman the bank credited the payment along with some extra as compensation. Since this I have used AO.com on line and the service is superb.",2018-11-29
1433,5bfff7cb9d37800a687db54f,"On Saturday 17th November, we bought a Fridge Freezer from your store in Purley Way, Corydon.In addition to the fridge, we purchased recycling and door reversal services. The delivery was scheduled for 23rd November.My wife took the day off for the delivery. On the 23rd November, as scheduled, the new fridge was delivered and the old fridge was taken away. However, the driver was unable to reverse the doors. When my wife asked for them to be reversed the delivery man said he was unable to do this and we should schedule a second visit for the door reversal. This is contrary to what we were led to believe in the store. We were led to believe that it would all be done at the same time.My wife then called your support number and scheduled a door reversal for 28th November. This time I took the day off. The evening before delivery we got a text advising a slot of 8:50am – 12:50pm for the delivery.We are having our home decorated at the moment and both the decorator and I were at home all day. At 13:20, I had become concerned that there may be a problem. I called the Team Knowhow customer service number at 13:27. I held for roughly 20 minutes and then got through to an operative.After passing the security questions and explaining the situation (as I saw it), the operative advised that an engineer had visited, nobody was home and a card had been posted into the door. The operative advised that the engineer described the front door as WHITE with glass panels. I attach a photograph of my BLUE front door, and I confirm that I was home all day, nobody knocked on my door and no card was posted in through the letterbox.The operative offered to rebook the appointment but was unable to offer me anything better than another all day timeslot. When I repeatedly requested a smaller timeslot, I was told that this was not possible. On this point, I wish to take issue. I can pay for a shorter timeslot, so I know it is possible. I appreciate mistakes can be made, but after two mistakes on your part, I believe you should now be demonstrating flexibility rather than expecting me to demonstrate even more flexibility.I have spent over £4,000 with Currys in the past 2-3 months. I am not someone who complains much. I feel that in this particular instance however, there has been negligence on behalf of your staff that we shouldn’t be expected to continue accepting.================UPDATE - 11/12/18================So despite Shauna so kindly offering to help, I forwarded all information as requested and haven't even had my email aknowledged.

I try as best to deal with this retailer online as my in shop experiences are not great. Unfortunately the product was no longer available for home delivery, which meant I had to visit my local store. Yes it was a busy weekend (Black Friday and Cyber Monday) but the car parking staff were efficient in keeping the traffic moving.In store I waited 20 minutes (in a long queue) at the counter only to be told that laptops had to be collected at the Know How counter. I waited another 25 minutes (with only one person in front of me) before being seen to. It seemed that the member of staff was successfully selling several purchases (on top of the reservation item) to the customer ahead of me so I waited patiently. It got to my turn and the member of staff took 12minutes to locate my laptop which was not even on the shelf behind him (there were several stacks waiting to be collected) but in the stock room.I have been told that their work is not commission based but he proceeded to try and sell further products despite me saying that I had exact cash only and could not afford the other items he was trying to sell. I politely told him that I had waited long enough and just wanted to pay and go. He did not listen and was clearly being rude but adamant to waffle his selling speech. When he eventually accepted my cash, he had to call another colleague to come and count it. this colleague began chatting to him about something else and I again politely reminded them that it had been a long wait already and I needed to go. This colleague then laughed and said ""okay how quick do you want me to count this money - I can do it in 30 seconds"". He then turned to his colleague and said - ""we need to be quick, she has waited too long"". I remained silent to avoid saying something unpleasant. They handed me my item by hand and I asked for a bag -- they looked down and said there were no more bags (but the customer in front of me had been issued a bag). They advised me to go to another counter and get a bag.I am not impressed by the lack of value for customer time and the unnecessary sarcasm shown by the rather pathetic members of staff.",2018-11-28

No text rec'd, so rang in this morning - the day of delivery (another 15 minutes or so wait), nothing on system so new operator says rescheduled for tomorrow. Fingers very much crossed.",2018-11-28

Nothing more they could do, so told to basically accept the error. The Brighton store told us we could have the lower spec one as a replacement as the price had now gone up since last week!!! An absolute joke of a store with no customer service what so ever.I wish i had bought from John Lewis as their customer service comes as standard. CURRYS DOESN'T KNOW WHAT IT IS",2018-11-28
1462,5bfdb4c89d37800868782883,"CURRY’S NO WORRIES I DONT THINK SOI ordered x2 Samsung TVs and x2 walk mounts (same product codes for each) online on Black Friday (23/11). I paid £4 delivery for delivery on Sunday (25/11) when someone would be in the house to receive. I got a 1 hour time slot from DPD. The driver turned up in said time slot. However 1 of the TV’s was missing. The other TV was in a Samsung box i.e. no outer box. My husband said to the delivery driver we had ordered 2 TV’s and was advised this would more than likely turn up the following day. Once the driver left my husband looked at the dispatch note that listed 2 TV’s. Also the delivery label weight was more in line with 2 TV’s than 1. He immediately rang up Currys and spent over an hour on the phone, a large amount of the time on hold. I rang up on Monday (26/11) and was advised someone be in touch by close of play (27/11). I rang up again at teatime towards close of play (27/11) and to be fair the young lad called Max was very polite however after speaking to a supervisor informed me the dispute enquiry between Currys and DPD would take 10-15 working days from the initial complaint on Sunday. I have been charged for all of the items. Total £581.98 including delivery. The timescales for resolution of this are not acceptable to me. Basically I have paid for something that hasn’t turned up and was ordered in good time for a gift.",2018-11-27
1463,5bfdade79d37800a687cc18e,"It’s almost as if the staff have been trained to be as unhelpful as possible. Bar the occasional polite and helpful member of staff, most of the curry’s team wouldn’t know what customer service was even if it slapped them in the face. I feel sorry for the odd person in this company that actually cares because it’s safe to say there’s only one prioty in they’re ethos: get the customers money at all costs.Hi Marcus, yes I can elaborate.For reference my order number CUR1857742996.On the 23/11/18 I ordered a copy of Forza Horizon 4 (Xbox One). I ordered and paid for it on the curry’s website because it stated that the item would be delivered to my nearest store on Newport road, Cardiff by 5pm on the 24/11/18. On the 25/11/18 at about 10.45 I made my way to the store, despite not having an email detailing anything about its delivery, but assuming it would be in the store. I then spent about 30 minutes in the store whilst various employees searched for the item in question. After 30 minutes I was told flatly that the item had never made its way to the store in the first place (not sure why I was waiting for people to search for it if it wasn’t there). Assuming that the item was just a bit late and that surely I would receive an email confirming its arrival the following day – Monday 26/11/18, I carried on with the rest of my Sunday. On Monday 26/11, I thought it might be time to find out where my purchase was, so I rang curry’s customer service. After half an hour on hold, I was told that the item had in fact been delivered to the store on the 24/11/18 at about 11.00. I was quite annoyed to be told that apparently my item had in fact been delivered to the store and was there at the time I had gone in to collect it, and went back to the store after I had finished work (26/11 - second visit to store). Once at the store, I explained that although I had received no emails as to the whereabouts of my purchase but according to the customer services team, it was in the store. I then waited for about 30 minutes again whilst members of staff looked for my item, to then be told again (rudely) that the item had never found its way to the store and that the customer services team must be mistaken. No offer of – would you like us to order you another one, would you like a refund, let’s find out where your order is etc. Instead, just – you will have to ring customer services back, it’s not our problem. At this point I’m quite irritated to say the least but decide to ring customer services back. After another half hour call I get through to someone that tells me he’s going to give me a tracking number so that I can look for where it is myself! After I tell him that’s not an acceptable solution he places me on hold whilst he calls the Newport road store and leaves me on hold for a further 10 minutes before the call cuts off (total call time for this call – 45 minutes. Solutions - 0). So, I call customer services back and wait another half an hour on hold. I get through to the first pleasant person I had dealt with at curry’s who informs me that the item, according to her system was delivered to the store but that she would email the store manager and that I would get a response within 24 hours. It has now been almost 48 hours and I’ve heard absolutely nothing from anyone. I am incredibly angry and disappointed. I have been spent approximately 3 hours on the phone, an hour in the store, an hour driving to and from the store, the petrol it takes to fuel the car, all just to try and get my hands on a game that I have ACTUALLY ALREADY BOUGHT, and not a single person seems to be able to help me! Absolutely awful customer service!Update (03/12/2018): It's now been 9 days since I should have recieved my product from currys and I have still not recieved any contact as to where my item is. I was told the that the store manager in the Newport Road, Cardiff store, would contact me in 24 hours, that was 5 days ago. I have no other choice but to ask my credit card company to retrieve the money.",2018-12-03

When done, noticed it only showed 12 months parts & labour.Emailed LG to query this and they replied that LG only ever cover 12 months. The other 4 years are covered by Currys/PC World.Emailed Currys/PC World via Ebay and guess what...........they say they only cover 12 months and the other 4 years are by LG.So NOTHING has changed in 6 years!Customers are still left to chase LG and Currys/PC World to get the illusive piece of paper that confirms 1) you have a 5 Year Guarantee and 2) who honours it!Trading Standards are going to be contacted regarding this issue and if Currys/PC World don't sort this out within the week, TV is going to be packed up and sent back to them!28/11/2018 - Another email received back from Currys/PC World stating they only ever do 12 month Guarantee!

The people on the phone lines are incompetent in their English and cannot understand what your saying nor can you understand what they are saying. After calling to ask on the day of store collection where my product is, they said my order is cancelled! I waited all week for my laptop and they didn't even bloody send me any emails or a call saying that my order is cancelled! After speaking with the manger, her response was ""Sorry we cannot do anything further, it is your fault for the cancelling of product"" Under the Distance Sales Regulation, the seller must clearly inform us of any cancellation of products, but no..... Currys is an absolute trash place to things. The sales team don't give any care to the customer, instead they get paid and they scam out the customers. The new Currys motto: "" Hey we'll take all your money and cancel your order and deliver you nothing!"" I agree with all the previous comments. The Currys sales team should be sacked entirely. Do they even know what customer needs are? Incompetent workers at Currys, who know nothing. NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM CURRYS! GO ARGOS!",2018-11-27

1467,5bfd88679d37800a687caa75,"Absolutely the worst customer service I have ever experienced. After ordering our cooker over a week ago, receiving email confirmation that it would be delivered on Saturday (paid for extra) and the money being taken off very quickly...we received no delivery after waiting at home the majority of the day. On phoning to find out what was happening with our delivery we were told it was a system error on their side and we will have to cancel our order, the money paid back onto the gift cards and then re-order again. No apologies, the fact that it was their fault and their system doesn't seemed to have made them any more committed to actually fixing the problem. When asked if we would get the same price for the cooker we were told no, maybe if we go in store. Again, no effort to redress this mistake on their part. They have so far only refunded portion of the purchase price, and despite us contacting them every day, the remainder remains sitting with them. We have received so many conflicting advises from their ""help"" desk that we have given up expecting a coherent answer as to the way forward. Oh and conveniently now the cooker is no longer on the special price and is out of stock. The worst experience I have ever had with a retailer. I would not recommend them to anyone and have actively been forewarning colleagues not to buy from Currys after this experience.UPDATE: Despite Currys replying on this review asking for further details, and having responded to them immediately, I have had no response from them. It seems these responses are just for show. Judging from their Facebook page this issue of not refunding customers is a common one.",2018-12-05

1469,5bfd85e39d37800a687ca8c9,"Payment taken but order blocked with no reason given. just told that order is now to be referred to a team in the Czech Republic and would take several days. I've had nothing via email other than the initial order placed notification. No order number ( I had to phone and ask to get this), no payment confirmation, no order status... nothing. and still nothing after phoning customer services.If I hadn't spent an hour on the phone I guess the order would have languished for eternity... that's the impression the very casual and non apologetic customer services rep gave me.Update------------Received a ""dispatch"" email and then on day of arrival in store had to phone support as did not get the expected ""arrived in store"" email. another laid back customer service rep informed me my order was still stuck in the blue lane ( What) and since the product was out of stock she had to cancel the order..sorry nothing we can do ! I informed her I'd been told payment had been taken but she assured me that it had not. After phone call checked my account and the payment had been taken. so now after 9 days and 2 hours on the phone I've got no TV and i'm down £129 with another 2 hours on the phone ahead of me. Can a senior rep please phone me and get this sorted out since you did not reply to my emails last time.Further update---------------Phoned again and this time rep says money has been taken and refund will take 3-5 days.. The last rep admitted that due to deamnd on black friday a percentage of the orders where frozen to ease load on the system and that they had stock issues. Why was I only told this after 10 days.Also the rep says I have to phone back to discuss a good will gesture after the refund has been processed!.. unable to do it now despite the fact they had cancelled the order 4 days ago...joke!I think they should compensate me now given that :1: spent 2.5 hours on telephone to incompetent staff that kept me in the dark.2: 2 visits to store for to collect a product that never arrived.2: no product that I'd paid for despite stock in shops.3: Lost black Friday opportunity elsewhere.4: They've had my money for at least 10 days.5. Currys takes your money first and reserves stock against your order afterwards if they can be bothered..This is not legitimate practice as a company should NEVER take your money unless they have reserved the stock for you. I'm seriously considering having this investigated as your systems don't appear to comply to strict online payment rules.Final UpdateAfter the second rep cancelled my order due to telling me they had sold out.. the product still on sale at a higher price online. This is illegal and is a scam called bait and switch. Basically it seems they only intended to sell a maximum quantity of this product at the low price and have opted to cancel all orders over the max despite taking the money and having the stock. It matters not where the stock is held.. Absolutely furious!!Yet another final final update6 days later and no refund. Phoned again and told I was not refunded because the money was never taken. Ahhhhhhhhg! I actually had to argue and insist this was escalated to the senior member of staff otherwise they would not have done a thing despite me stating the it was on my bank statement as a take. They tried BS me with some mumbo jumbo about card transactions authorisation... unfortunately for them I an eCommerce developer who implements payment systems and had the knowledge to cal their bull. They actually told me to go to my bank and chase it with them! .. really. Finally got a call back from a senior member of staff who seemed sad to admit the money had been taken... no S*** Sherlock. Fingers crossed for a manual refund in 5 days. He very reluctantly gave me a £20 voucher which I think is not enough...if it arrives.",2018-12-10

We rang customer service and the told us they can come again next Wednesday 5th of December, and in the meantime we are with a two years old child without washing machine and with the kitchen floor destroy!

1491,5bfc64469d37800a687c2e65,Bought a TV in the Black Friday sale online and paid extra for next day delivery option which showed as available for my postcode. Was going to buy from JL but their delivery was longer. Later that day I received a text message from Currys saying that they couldn’t do next day delivery and would let me know within the next 3 days when they could deliver. Called customer services Saturday morning who said stock delivery scheduled for Sunday so should get delivery early in the week as they were expecting 50 TVs and had 43 outstanding orders - by this time JL delivery was showing 5 days delivery so decided to stick with Curry’s. Got another text Sunday evening saying that they would be rescheduling my delivery and I should hear shortly. I thought this was good news but thought I would still call them Monday just to confirm. When I called I was then told that my TV wouldn’t be in stock for another 10days and then they would arrange a delivery date! Lady on the phone was very rude and basically told me I shouldn’t have been told stock was coming in Sunday and that I would just have to put up with it. So I cancelled the order and found another online retailer who has guaranteed delivery in 3 days. In this day and age this sort of customer service (and I hesitate to call it service) is totally unacceptable and I certainly will never purchase anything from Currys again.,2018-11-26

I checked my emails at 6am Sunday and there was no confirmation of delivery for that day. So I made a note of the delivery number and went onto the knowhow tracking website and found out it was going to be delivered on FRIDAY and not that day what we had paid for. I waited till 9am to ring customer services and spoke to a unhelpful woman with no resolution to our problem as both myself and my wife work and couldn't take delivery of the cooker on Friday as there'd be nobody in to sign for it besides we'd already been four days without a means of cooking and they were telling us we'd have to go another five days. Not acceptable. I just informed the woman we call into the local branch to see if the situation could be resolved. Another big mistake. We went and I asked to speak to the manager.

1516,5bfa9b2f9d378009543f7d15,"I recently (15 November) bought a Sonos Beam in Currys PC World. I paid £399 for the item. At the point of sale, I was told that if the price was lowered on Black Friday, I would receive the difference as a refund. I may well have bought the item anyway, but being told this certainly made it a no brainer. I thought this was excellent service by Currys and have sang their praises to others since.How wrong I was. On Black Friday and still today (25th November) the price was lowered by £50 to £349. I went in today to collect the refund and was told that they would not pay it. The various reasons they came up with:* I had to return within 7 days (impossible as Black Friday was more than 7 days from the date of sale).* The black Friday protection scheme did not apply to the Sonos Beam.* If there was such an offer, I would have been given a receipt mentioning this.I don't think the original salesman was lying to me, I think he just got his facts wrong. However, I know what I was told and while Currys may not be legally obliged to pay a refund, the fact that they won't says all you need to know about the ethos of the company.Needless to say, I have learnt from the experience and will not use Currys again for anything.Update:As you can see, Currys have responded to this review to state that price match can only be claimed within 7 days. This is certainly true. However, my complaint was not in relation to price match (as they well know), it was being told that if, specifically, the price went down on Black Friday (as it did) I could come in and be refunded. I did and I wasn't. I stated previously that I don't think the salesman was lying to me, he just got his facts wrong. I know what was said to me by the salesman at purchase, I know I was told I would be refunded if the black Friday price went down. I am angry at the implicit accusation of making this up. I didn't.As an interesting side note, I just bought over £200 worth of items from Argos in the same town of Workington. This included buying a Google Home Hub at the black Friday/Cyber Monday price of £99. When I arrived to pickup the item, the price had gone up to £139 and this is what initially came up on the till. I pointed this out and it was resolved in a matter of minutes by the friendly and courteous staff. And at no time did they accuse me of lying. Kudos to Argos.",2018-11-27

We planned on buying a washing machine to take home today , after choosing a model we approached a group of 4 members of staff one of whom was chewing gum with their mouth wide open, and all clearly too interested in their private conversation to assist us properly. The model we wanted wasn't in stock and instead of being offered options we were told we could drive from Ashford to Maidstone to collect one or wait over a week to have it delivered at an additional charge. We explained we wanted to take one home today and we told that wasn't an option!

The phone operator then tells me I won’t be getting my item today and it won’t be delivered until at least 7-9 days later!! Their lack of communication was absolutely appalling and resulted in me wasting a huge amount of my time. Had I not taken the initiative to call, I would have been waiting all day for something that was never going to arrive.

1542,5bf81a839d37800b74c74f82,"Correspondence TeamKNOWHOWPO BOX1686Sheffield S25 YB13 August 2017Re :DON’T KNOW HOW!!!I feel compelled, despite my busy life and work schedule, to write to inform your company how extremely poor your delivery service is.I bought a washing machine from Currys on 06.05.2017. It has taken me some time to get around to writing to you as frankly I have more important things to do with my time but to leave the matter unreported would simply not be right. Furthermore the experience was so badly handled by Know How and caused me so much distress that I could not bring myself to write at the time because I was so cross about it.On Saturday 06.05.2017 I went into Currys at Plumpton Retail Park, Harrogate and purchased a washing machine. The service at the store was good and I was advised that there was a free delivery service which was quick and efficient. I had no washing machine at that time and needed one urgently so the reportedly speedy delivery was very welcome. I was also advised that I would be contacted shortly and advised of a delivery date and time. It all sounded perfect.On Sunday 07/05/2017 I received several message, firstly to advise me and then repeatedly to remind me that my washing machine would be delivered on Tuesday 08.05.207 between 7am and 10.59 am.I am the General Manager of a local Care Home in the area and could not be away from work due to my busy schedule. However my workplace is only a few minutes’ drive from the delivery address. I therefore phoned 'Deliveries' and spoke 'John' to request a call 30 mins before the driver arrived at the destination on Monday 08.05.2017. This would give me adequate time to be at the destination before the delivery arrived. I requested the call be made to my office landline number because, as I explained to 'John', my mobile phone does not have reliable network coverage at my workplace. He agreed that was not an issue and would put my request forward. I felt very reassured that all was going well.The next morning (ie on the scheduled delivery day, Tuesday 9 May) I was anxiously waiting for the call and was planning my work schedule appropriately to enable me to dash to the delivery address once I received the early warning phone call. But when the delivery time 'window period' expired at 11am I had not received a call. So I then decided to go to the delivery address. On arrival I saw a note on the door mat advising that KNOW HOW delivery men had left as there was no one at home. BUT I DID NOT RECEIVE THE CALL AS I HAD REQUESTED AND AS HAD BEEN AGREED THE DAY BEFORE!I promptly called the delivery service and co-incidentally spoke to a gentleman call John but this was not the same John I had made the earlier arrangements with. I therefore had to explain to 'John 2' what had happened, including the information about NOT using my mobile number. He said he would make enquiries and get back to me. He did phone me back about ten minutes later and said the driver was still in Harrogate and would return to the delivery address (where I was located at the time) within ten minutes. He also told me that the driver said he had phoned but could not get through. John 2 therefore advised the driver that he'd rung the wrong number (ie my mobile) as he should have called my work landline number instead. I thought 'John 2' was very helpful and I appreciate his help very much.I had several appointments at work that day and did not wish to waste time but I was told the delivery people would return within 10-15minutes so I waited at the delivery address. After 50 minutes I was becoming very anxious as I was missing my appointments at work so I contacted your deliveries again and explain the situation to John 2. However, before I heard back from him I received a call from one of my work colleagues to advise that the delivery driver had now rung my office (I wasn't there of course) and gave me a mobile number of the delivery man who was requesting that I call him on 07803481733. I promptly called him back only to be told that he would not return that day!! Remember, this is AFTER I'd waited 50 minutes on the assurance that the delivery was only 10-15 minutes away, as arranged between Know How operatives!! The delivery driver further advised me that I would have to rearrange the delivery. I informed him that I was told he was already en route to return and I had waited in vain for over an hour (by this stage).I then rang deliveries AGAIN and this time spoke to Anna. I asked to speak to a senior person but I was told I couldn’t!!! I therefore had to relate the whole story to yet another member of your staff, following which the delivery was schedule for the next day. Again I emphasized the fact that I needed to be notified on my office landline about half an hour before the delivery and NOT on my mobile as my mobile has unreliable network in my workplace.The following day, Wednesday 10 May, I had a text from the KNOW HOW team to let me know that the delivery will be between 08.20am and 12.20pm, I waited anxiously again for the phone call to alert me that the delivery was imminent so that I could go from my office to the delivery address in good time. Again when it got to 12.15pm I decided to go to the delivery address and wait believing that delivery must now be imminent as the delivery 'time window' was nearing expiry. Before leaving my office I instructed my staff at work to let the driver know if he rings that I would be at the property. However, soon after I left whilst I was still driving to the address I received a call from a colleague informing me that the delivery depot had called to let me know that I was not home when the delivery men arrived and they had left. I was very close to the address and fortunately, as I approached the end of the street to the property, I saw a van with the logo KNOW HOW moving away from the house and I became quite excited that the delivery could happen and end my anxiety. I was in my car so I stopped adjacent to the truck, wound my window down and was waving my hand out of the window to get the diver's attention to stop. So he pulled up next to me and stopped. He was in an elevated position in his cab with truck's engine running and I was sitting in my car so I had to speak loudly for him to hear me. I told him that the delivery was for me and could he kindly turn round and make the delivery. He said he could not he has to move on to another delivery. I told him he was supposed to ring me before he arrived and he claimed he did. I told him he must have called my mobile which was not the correct number to ring. I informed him that the depot just rang my work number and we got the call. I beckoned him to follow me back towards the house to make the delivery but as I proceeded to the house he just drove off!! I was so disappointed, frustrated and upset, I could not believe that the delivery van was 2 minutes away and yet the driver chose to simply drive away. I cannot believe, even now, that any operative in a customer service job thinks that that is an appropriate way to conduct business on behalf of their employer. If I found one of my staff conducting themselves in a comparable manner I would definitely take remedial action. DON’T KNOW HOW !!By this stage I had had to leave work on two separate occasions, causing unwelcome disruption to my business. And to add insult to injury I was treated in this completely inappropriate manner.I contacted deliveries AGAIN and spoke to yet another operative, Leah, whereupon I had to explain YET AGAIN what had happened and that I felt the situation was completely unacceptable. Leah said she could arrange another delivery as the men had moved on. I told her that the service was really not acceptable and I needed to speak to someone more senior as I felt it was long passed the stage when someone at Know How needed to take ownership of the situation. After a lot of persuasion on my part she undertook to speak to her manager and asked me to wait on the telephone. I waited for a long time and eventually the phone cut off. Of course I don't know why but based on my experience to date you can possibly guess what I thought?I then decided to go and visit the local Currys, where I bought the washing machine. I met a young salesman and I started to explain my situation to him. He told me I needed to speak to deliveries and pointed to the Know How desk in another area of the shop. My heart sank! But I went to the counter and there were two members of staff hovering over a computer screen chatting between themselves. After several minutes and due to my own time constraint I asked for attention (I was still taking time out from work at this juncture). Angela came forward to assist me; I proceeded to tell her about the delivery experience so far (I've lost count how many times I've explained things to members of your staff). She listened and then proceeded to ring the depot.Whilst still on the phone, Angela said to me that the delivery men said that I was rude to them as I shouted and as a result I would not be getting the delivery. Furthermore, the delivery had been cancelled because the washing machine had been re-allocated to someone else and that there were no more left of that model!! I could not believe what I was hearing! I explained to Angela that I'd had to speak loudly for the men to hear me as they were in a big truck with the engine running and I was in my car. Angela then ""shushed"" me!! (this, after I was told that I had been rude!! - the entire saga was akin to a sketch from Faulty Towers) and said that I had a choice of a refund or buy a different washing machine. At this stage, I believe if I had lost my temper, I think most right-thinking people would understand why and would feel it justified.I finally returned to work very distressed and I informed my colleagues what had happened and to my surprise a couple of my colleagues stated that the",2018-11-23

The fridge came by post and today just after 11 am two delivery guys turned up and to be truthful I actually thought that Laurel and Hardy had turned up. (Yes, back to comedy for a bit) They dragged my old fridge freezer out not realising it was on wheels. I followed them out to see my new fridge freezer already removed from its packaging with a dent laying on the pavement. I told them that I was told that it would be removed from packaging. He offered me a 20% discount. I accepted just to get rid of them. For those of a certain age will have seen the piano sketch with Laure and Hardy, well just make it a fridge freezer instead of a piano and you will get the point as this bumbling team tried to get the old fridge freezer into their van and then dropped it on the pavement just missing many cars.

1546,5bf7f9909d3780035821b172,"I brought a TV from currys in January 2018, few moths down the line I was experiencing some minor issues with the TV (kept disconnecting from WiFi, was going on to Netflix when pressing the guide button.) so sent it in for a minor repair, team know how came and picked my TV up for repair and said it would take 5 working days. I then track the progress to see there was query with the repair, so called currys to see what the problem was to be told they had smashed my TV screen while it was in transit to the repair shop! So I wasn't happy with this, however I appreciate accidents happen, and said OK so you broke my TV can I have a replacement or a store credit voucher so that I can get myself a new TV. They told me and I quote 'its fine we will just repair it and it will take 28 days!' sorry you just broke my TV and I'm supposed to be happy with you just repairing it and sending it back, as I only sent it in for a minor repair!. They basically told me there was nothing I could do about it, I ask for the complaints department to then be told they don't have one and there is nobody I can complain too!.I reluctantly call them again a few days later for an update on my TV to be told that my TV had be written off so its was unrepairable, and that its takes a couple of days to process and that I would receive an instore credit voucher for the value of my TV. I initially thought lovely problem solved, couldn't of been anymore wrong! I phoned them again to check the progress of my voucher code, to be told for 3 days in a row it was still processing! So on the fourth day i wanted it resolved with my voucher code. I spent about an hour on the phone being transferred from department to department, some had problems with finding my account and details and they just in general didn't have a clue or even care. Finally get through to someone that can find my details and gives me a reference number to give to the next person he transfers to me so that they can give me my voucher code. However the next person tells me that the decision has been changed and they are still waiting to see if the manafacture will repair my TV or whether it will be store credit! So somehow I have now gone backwards 5 days as I was already told it was a write off and I was waiting on a code to be given. I then demanded to talk to the manager who then told me the staff had mislead me and that he didn't know why I was told I would be getting store credit. So I told him that that's what I was offered that's what I agreed to so that's what I want, to be told no because the desision hasn't been made. So apparently the man is doing a internal investigation, as I reminded him all calls were recorded, and now waiting for them to get in contact. So disgusted with the whole process I'm still stuck without a TV and the issue hasn't been resolved through no fault of my own!.

1556,5bf6b53b9d378009543e5916,"Terrible customer service and poorly worded returns policy that is fraudulent imo. Their policy states ""if you are less than satisified with any item for any reason you may return it in its original packaging within 14 days"" but they then go on to say that its just one specific reason...if the goods are faulty and once youve used the item no refund will be issued if its not faulty.1) how is anyone supposed to know if they are less than satisfied with their purchase unless they take it out the box.2) its not any reason its literally one reasonI purchased a Playstation VR bundle pack from their website for £220 which included headset, camera, a pair of move controllers, and two games (one physical and one digital). I already owned a VR game so tested the headset out on that first. After 10 mins of play i felt sick and was losing my balance which is potentially dangerous. Moments later i was actually sick. This nauseating feeling stayed with me for the rest of the day and was pretty dangerous when crossing the road later. I put the camera and headset back in the box. The physical game was still in its shrink wrap and the code for the digital game was unused. The move controllers hadnt been touched either. I rang them up and asked for a refund and the initial person chloe couldnt connect me to a manager and requested a call back for the following day. An hour later i received that call from someone called gemma who also sounded about 18 saying the same thing and claiming to be a manager. I get that the headset is used but it was literally 10 mins and is still working fine. She also didnt care but tryed condescending me. I feel that the health risks are a valid reason and im not just returning a 9.99 game i dont like. Incidentally why would that be a problem anyway because their policy states ""less than satisified for any reason"" remember?Spent about 2000 with them on other products for black friday. Last time i buy anything from them. Doesnt surprise me there is a plethora of negative reviews underneath mine",2018-11-22
1557,5bf6a9fc9d378009543e5361,"NEVER have anything to do with Currys again. My 85 year mother bought a washing machine, cooker & fridge freezer. She paid £85 for the cooker to be fitted. They were due to be delivered between 9.30am & 1.35pm. The fitter rang before the delivery. Delivery happened shortly after his call. That was the last we heard. Despite numerous calls to his mobile which he ignored then turned his phone off. I rang Currys eventually getting through to be told the fitter had told them he couldn't wait for delivery as it was going to be 1 - 2 hours!!! Lying****! Currys then told me that they could not book another for a week. So they are happy leaving an 85 year old with no means of cooking!! NICE COMPANY!! I told them we had bought, paid for & booked the fitter for today. They wouldn't budge so I told them to shove it & give me back the £85. This they also couldn't do until the lads had got back & released the job (this will be the one they didn't do). Thank god there are some genuine lovely people in the world as someone came to her rescue & fitted it for her.This company is the worlds worst & I will never buy from them again EVER!!Angry is not the word!!",2018-11-22
1558,5bf682819d37800358212a09,"We ordered a fridge/freezer in store and paid cash as we were moving into our first house and had scrimped and saved spare cash to buy appliances. We picked a delivery day which suited us. And that is where the good experience ends.Our delviery was not made on the chosen day and no one bothered to communicate with us to say it wasn't going to happen. We rearrange for the next day - my partner is self employed so has the flexibility to be abel to leave work for deliveries. This time we didn't receive the promised 'half hour warning' call and instead picked up a very brief voicemail saying the delivery driver was on our doorstep but no one was answering so we'd have to rearrange for another day. We rearranged for a Sunday, knowing we'd both be home and, when there was just an hour left of our timeslot and we hadn't heard anything again, we rang customer services to be told our product hadn't been booked to be delivered that day. A week later than planned, by some miracle, our fridge/freezer arrived. But it was damaged. It works fine, but given the hassle we went through to get it, this was not good enough. The delviery drivers were great and rang the appropriate people their end to register the product as damaged and advised someone would be in touch to sort out a refund of 20% of the product value. We have had the product a month and not received any call about the refund. I rang customer services, because emailing them takes more than the advised 5 days to get a reply, to be told the drivers were wrong to tell us this and that we had to go in store to get our refund.We have no paperwork from the drivers to prove that our fridge is damaged, no refund and all customer services will offer is £10 per missed delivery. Buying from Curry's has been more stressful than actually moving house, all because they can't get their act together to offer even half decent customer service.

1561,5bf5a3069d3780035820ecc4,Braehead; Glasgow.My wife and I visited this branch on Sunday 18/11/2018. As our integrated washing machine had given up the ghost and needed to purchase a replacement. We had a look around and then needed to ask a question regarding the fitting of the existing cabinet door to the new machine for which we did receive an answer. The answer involved their fitter fitting the appliance. The cost of fitting on the website was quoted as £90. This seemed expensive but it involved drilling holes in the new machine we would have paid the fee. We then spotted a banner displayed above a display of two integrated machines advertising fitting and re-cycling of an old machine for £65. The price for this on the website for this is £110 so quite a saving. We then asked a sales assistant to check this out. We were surprised to find out that the the offer was for free standing machines only. The banner did not state this and considering where the banner was displayed we were dumbfounded. The sales assistant just stood with a blank stare and was unable to make a reply even when we pointed out that this might be considered false advertising. Most sales people in this situation would have spoken to a manager to try and resolve the situation as well as losing a sale. On Sunday evening I emailed their so called team knowhow and as yet have not received a reply. Earlier this year I purchased a new laptop from the same branch. The staff on this occasion were very helpful advising me that a chrome book rather than a full laptop would suit my needs rather than spending extra cash on a full laptop and I was grateful for the service provided. That is why I used Curry's website to contact them rater than use this website. This is a poor performance all round from Curry's. We do have a photograph of the misleading banner. We have since purchased a washing machine elsewhere.,2018-11-21

With hindsight, this was a bad decision as I fell victim to their utterly unreliable and unefficient online business and their in-store customer service is so bad, I was forced to cancel my order in protest and swear I would never shop with them ever again. I mean in what kind of stores you get told ""don't be ridiculous"" in front of the queue of other customers just for asking for a more specific time to come and collect the item?

1573,5bf43eaa9d378003582062f4,"Like many others, if I could give a zero (or less) I would. Everything started well as I purchased a TV and bracket from my local store and arranged for them to fit it to my wall last Saturday. The drivers turned up that afternoon, dropped off the TV, but said they didn’t do the installation and I should call customer services to get it sorted. I did this only for it to be confirmed that they should have in fact installed it.Frustratingly I then rearranged for someone to install the TV this Monday and …. no one turned up. Spoke with customer services again (which takes an age to get through to) to find out the crew who had been assigned my job didn’t have the capability to install the TV. I asked to speak with a manager but was refused so had to settle for a call back the next day. I got the call back from a manager who said the issue was that my postcode wasn’t recognized (as it is a new build) and that they couldn’t find me. I explained that they had actually been to my address at the weekend so this was nonsense (they had no answer for this). I was then told they don’t even do installations on a Saturday in my area and that they could come the next Monday which I refused as I obviously I have to earn money to pay for services I don’t receive. I said I would only entertain it if I had a full refund of the delivery / installation charge which they refused. As it stands this still isn't resolved. Essentially I was either lied to or the victim of extreme incompetence, or both. Firstly I had an installation booked for a day they apparently don’t do them, had a second attempt fail because they sent the wrong people (who didn’t tell me they weren’t coming) and was told my address was the problem and they couldn’t find it (even though they actually visited my property). Essentially they want me to work around them and keep wasting my own time waiting for them to decide which story to come up with next. Oh, and apparently I shouldn’t be too harsh because they are struggling to get the engineers to fulfil the service. Probably shouldn’t offer something you can’t fulfil then.

Sunday was announced as the replacement day. Told this was not acceptable the individual on the phone suggested I ring Customer Services. I explained, politely, that it was not for me to solve what was his/his company’s problem and once he/they had solved it – and it ought to be that afternoon as we had made arrangements to be in from 0700-1900 – he could ring me back. He said he would do so. He did not. Customer Services, when I explored it later that day, had a system which precluded me from entering what I know to be the correct Order number. No matter how I tried – five times – it was impossible orally to convey what I wished. I wrote a clear message setting out the above and repeating that Sunday was not acceptable. Saturday came and went, with radio silence as to the projected delivery. At 2029 on Saturday night a text told me that Team KnowHow would deliver on Sunday between 1050 and 1450. By pure chance, at 1500 when the van arrived, someone was available and the machine is installed. I should make clear that the two gentlemen who brought and plumbed it were quick, efficient and pleasant. This is one of the worst examples of cavalier lack of respect for the customer I have seen in recent times. Wholly unsatisfactory.

I was waiting for 9 days to call me back and let me know when they are able to deliver the item that I ordered. Nothing. I decide to call them and one lady told me that the dryer it's not in the stock. Finally after 2 days after my call they had that in stock and I asked them if I can have my delivery in the Weekend (as we are not working and are the only days that we can receive it) and they booked me for delivery on Saturday 1.30 to 5.30. Whole Saturday I was waiting for the dryer with my partner. After that I called in costumer service they apologized for that but they didn't have enough time to deliver our item and they booked another delivery for Sunday between 11 to 3.30. We were waiting again and the delivery called us 3.05 and they told us that they cannot find a parking and they left. So so unprofessional. So frustrated for the servicing. Unacceptable. I won't buy again and I don't recommend that to nobody. We spent whole weekend to wait for an item that we never received.,2018-11-18

When I called customer services they said they can see the order on their system but it hadn't gone through. WHY give me a delivery date and WHY not tell me there was a problem?

1633,5bec48429d378009543ad5eb,"**UPDATE** So after contacting the email given, as I expected they have confirmed the position already stated that they are not responsible and will not provide the refund that they should based on an item not being as described. Typical Currys and shows exactly what they think of their customers. The bit I love as well is them referring me to an Alternative Dispute Resolution Service such as the Ombudsmen. Excerpt from their reply below""Taking your complaint further:We are obliged to inform you that you have the right to refer your complaint to an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) provider. You have up to twelve months to do this.We need to advise you that ADR is voluntary and it is not a procedure to which we subscribe. Therefore any ADR decision would not be binding.""In other words no matter what the outcome we will not honour it or be bound by the decision. Great customer service there.I have made a claim against Currys regarding the Samsung KS8000 TV I bought in 2016. This relates to an issue with TV not being as described at point of sale due to the lack of the Smart Things functionality. My rights under the Sale of Goods Act 2015 allow for a full refund for an item that is not as described. Currys Know How CEO team have refused they are at fault and offered a measly £150 compensation (why offer anything if you are not in the wrong?) on a TV that was £1350 and a free smart things hub from Samsung. There are many consumers taking this action against Currys, Richer Sounds and John Lewis with differing success. Richer Sounds are offering full refunds to customers after losing an ADR case, a procedure to which they subscribe and John Lewis have given full refunds to some customers. Currys are holding firm that it is not their responsibility. I understand they are entering mediation with a customer that has taken them to the small claims court over this matter. It will be interesting to see the outcome of that. Head over to the Samsung KS owners refund page to find out how to make your claim and maybe they will start doing the right thing if enough follow suit.This is definitely the last time I purchase anything from Currys now I am fully aware how they operate.",2018-11-15

After pressing a large number of option buttons an automated voice advised me that I would be put through to an operator in “five minutes”, “Twenty minutes later” I finally spoke with a human being “I think”. She gathered all the information and told me that she would get somebody from Warrington to call me, that was about lunchtime. “Nobody called at all”.

I asked him why nobody from the store had rung me and he said “we might have been busy, how would you like it if I just left you at the counter to answer the phone”, Is that the quality or mindset of their staff.Eventually he advised me that the toaster only left their store on the 28th Nov and had gone back to Tefal and would be up to 30 days repair.Over the years I have spent many thousands with them, but that is finished.

As soon as the Knowhow guy arrived it was obvious by his attitude he did not want to do the installation. Because washer was next to a dishwasher he refused to install as he would need to pull out dishwasher and left. However if he had took a moment to pull out the washer all the connections were directly behind washer, but he wanted to get away asap.

1669,5be84d5f9d3780056886a5d3,"Ordered an indesit washer dryer which included free removal of old machine and installation. Two guys delivered the machine however said they were unable to complete installation as I needed a plumber to turn off the water and replace my pipes under the sink. On calling out a plumber, he completed the job in less than a minute (with no need for replacement parts or turning off water) - all that needed to be done was to connect the hose, the delivery men obviously have no idea about installation and caused me to incur unnecessary costs. A week later I noticed a leak, Curry's sent out another of their know how delivery men who checked it and identified a fault with the actual machine. This was replaced however this 'know how' installer had a print out of how to plumb in a washing machine and left it too far out so it was obstructing the drawers which then couldn't open. He checked to ensure the machine was working properly however when spinning, it made a terrible high pitched squealing sound. I was advised to just use it a few times to see if it would disappear, unsurprisingly a week later it still sounds the same so now I need this one removed also. Needless to say, I won't be accepting an Indesit replacement. Had I have read these reviews prior to purchasing, I would have avoided Curry's at all cost. I would not recommend Curry's and I definitely would not recommend Indesit washer dryer XWDE 861480X",2018-11-11
1670,5be830b59d37800a4cdacb29,Shopping for a new washing machine at Stafford store. The sales person d not have been more helpful. However delivery was a different matter entirely. I paid and booked for delivery for between 1 pm and 5 pm as I was working and had to arrange for a friend to be at my property. The delivery arrived at 11 15 am fortunately my freeing was just arriving at this time. When the washing machine was unpacked it was found to have several dents down one side so was not unpacked any further. It then took at least 45 minutes to get through to th.e relevant department. Delivery is now arranged for 13 November between 1+ 5 pm. We were also told that I would have to pay again for delivery but after challenging this were told that it would be waived. Here’s hoping that there will not be any problems this time.,2018-11-11

I paid extra for delivery and taking away the old appliances. Turns out they delivered a fridge without a power lead. When we called up they said it wasn't their problem ""we can't be expected to check every little part"".What the hell? If I pay for delivery and installation I expect you to at least check it can be plugged in. Don't be aggressive about it on the phone.Practical upshot is that it's taken two hours of calls to various anonymous call centres to get another on its way, plus a wasted Sunday morning waiting for the re-delivery. Be warned, Currys don't give out any contact details so its impossible even to speak to the store you bought stuff from.So good service in the store, but the delivery and installation has been so poor, rude, unhelpful and frustrating that I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.

Dishwasher was badly damaged when I unpacked it, phoned immediately and told I must return to shop with receipt to arrange collection and delivery of replacement. This caused inconvenience to myself and employer, at the store they couldn’t do anything as I had not been told to bring information from inside of door, a total waste of time. This compounded how difficult and inconvenient the returns policy is, I have no complaint with store staff but the service from back room staff is atrocious. I felt so strongly about it I cancelled the order and then have to jump through hoops to get a refund, I made a formal complaint and that was a joke and waste of time. All that happens is it is recorded, I did not hear a single apology in 10/15 minute call either for the damage or trouble caused, once they have the machine back at depot I have to ring them to get refund and discuss if I warrant a gesture of goodwill or compensation. I was challenged when I questioned this and the returns process I was told # havent you read your receipt that confirms the policy and monies are not refunded until we have received goods# it does not. I don’t think curry’s understand how an effective complaints procedure works, it should be driven by them not the customer. I don’t hold any hope that I will receive any satisfaction or that curry’s will be bothered about loosing my custom, they should.

I went in to their Westfield store today during my lunch break to buy a pair of apple AirPods. I opened the sealed/plastic wrapped box as soon as I left the shop and was surprised to find the AirPods were not as I expected. They looked to be a counterfeit and the case did not even have the right type of socket for the lightning cable. I returned to the store within 5 minutes of leaving to report this and to have the item checked over. To my shock, instead of apologising to me for selling me a counterfeit product, I faced an inquisition from several members of staff who were insinuating that I was somehow trying to cheat them by replacing a counterfeit pair of AirPods I had hidden on my person. They said that I should have opened the box before I left to check. That is patently rediculous. I am a honest person who would never do something to defraud anyone and I can damn well afford a pair of headphones. I was made to feel discriminated against based on the Curry’s staff’s prejudices. I felt exasperated and had to show them my NHS work ID to show them I am a doctor and not a common criminal. I have never felt so degraded in my life. Eventually, the store supervisor agreed to replace the counterfeit item for me, after me being treated with suspicion and contempt by other members of his staff. There was not once an apology to me for the selling me a fake item, nor for the way they treated me. I was gobsmacked by the fact Curry’s, what I always considered to be a reputable store, could sell its customer a counterfeit product. I was left angry and exasperated by the way I was treated.

I rang customer services tonight to be told that the earliest that delivery could be made was next Thursday. Having wasted one day's holiday today, I had no intention of wasting another one, even if I could have taken a day off, which I can't. What a load of rubbish this company is. I was warned by various family members and friends that they were utterly incompetent but didn't listen. I will never shop there again - so well done Curry's - your great customer service has cost you one customer for certain but I don't suppose you care because if you did, you wouldn't keep on being so ridiculously inept. Team know-how - what a joke - more like team no-can't.",2018-11-06
1706,5be1f22f9d37800b643e24ad,"I recently ordered an item from Currys online. No problems here, apart from they were not able to deliver to my local store. Instead I selected the home delivery option.My problems started to arise when I got a call from the delivery driver. He could not find my address. Instead, he told me the parcel would be taken to the dispatch centre for me to collect- a 25 minute drive away from my home address. I arranged to pick up the parcel, and on arrival after 20 minutes of waiting I was told my parcel was lost. Thus I had to come home empty handed, having wasted over an hour of my time plus travel costs. They told me to contact Currys regarding replacement/refund.Today I called Currys, and after some time on hold I was put through to a person from 'Customer Care'. All I wanted was for the item to be resent to my local store so I could collect. Instead, I was told currys would have to conduct an internal investigation before this could happen, which will take up to seven working days. I told them this was not acceptable, as I had booked someone to install the item ordered at the weekend. I then asked for a refund, so I could order from another shop. Again this was not possible until after their internal investigation.So right now, Currys have around £400 of my money and I have nothing to show for it. On top of this, they have caused inconvenience to an electrician as I have had to cancel him. Currys were not willing to accept any liability for the issue and could only keep blaming their courier. Unfortunately, they were not able to grasp the fact that having bought a product from their website, I am their customer. I kept explaining to the representative that if Currys choose to use a third party courier, that is then their liability, and they should resolve matters amicably. The only response I kept getting was this was their policy. CURRYS, YOUR POLICY STINKS! It shows you don't care about your customers. Then again, based on your average Trustpilot rating, you didn't need me to tell you this.",2018-11-06
1707,5be1e5fa9d3780097ce02642,"Worst service I’ve ever experience. I purchased from Currys PC World in Liffey Valley, Dublin. I purchased a chest of freezer €209.99 on 17/10/2018 and paid an additional €20 for delivery to County Mayo. The date was agreed and it arrived on the date 25/10/2018, I got the delivery drivers to open the item to discover it was damaged. The delivery drivers were rude said it wasnt that bad, however I have pictures to prove otherwise and the offered me a discount of 10% I refused this as the product would have been void of warranty. I sent the product back with them and wanted a replacement. Since then I have heard absolutely nothing, I have tried contacting Currys PC World numerous of times all of which i have times and dates and was told that no replacement product is been sent and if I want my money back I have to go back to the Liffey Valley store. Please note that this is a three hour journey from County Mayo and there are no Currys PC world in Mayo. I have waited for someone else to contact me from the Liffey Valley store and this has not happened. Needless to say this is absolutely ridulous and I’m currently down €229.99 and no chest freezer.

I can't even remember how many emails I sent them and won't go into the boring stories of the useless answers, eventually, yawn, after 4 months, and me relentlessly pursuing them, they gave me a new door for the freezer, however, the fellow who delivered it claimed he couldn't reverse the doors, because it's not part of his job!!! At that point I gave up, found a neighbour who could do the job. This company simply give you the runaround in the hope that you'll give up and go away, And by the way, they are NOT registered with the Ombudsman, and that tells me that they have so many complaints that they don't want to deal with and are an unethical company.",2018-11-06

The young man seemed to be on auto pilot, he reeled off everything I needed to know as if it was scripted. He was very polite but clearly needed to move on quickly. I was passed to another young man, having reached a decision between two sets. He ran through the pros and cons of each....like a train. However, I managed to make my mind up on what exactly I wanted having listened intently.This man run through the paper work and asked me to go to front desk.I was flabbergasted as I needed advice on another product but he’d disappeared out of site in a flash!The next man I spoke to about the other product I wanted information on was very nice, polite but he stank of B.O.I went to front desk and the guy who served me was most helpful: if it wasn’t for him I wouldn’t of had the television delivered on the date agreed with ‘Mr. disappeared’, he had not completed the necessary documentation despite telling me he had done so!Unfortunately, this very helpful young man on front desk looked as if he needed a good bath. His fingernails were filthy, so was his hair.I honestly feel dreadful talking like this about people. I hate complaining full stop. However, the majority of staff looked like they needed a good bath and clean clothes, I feel compelled to point this out.Surely this cannot be right: some years ago staff looked clean, tidy and presentable.

The salesman was very helpful and we completed the purchase and arranged for delivery today (6 November) as well as arranging installation of the new dishwasher. We also arranged for the old dishwasher to be removed. We also rearranged our day to ensure that we were in all day today.This morning I checked online to see what our estimated delivery slot was. Initially the date was 6 November still but no note on the time slot. At about 9.25am I checked again only to find the delivery / installation slot had been changed to 2 December, almost 4 weeks away.My husband contacted them only to be advised that the team who plan the routes and deliveries are regularly changing dates and have done so hundreds of times. This is totally unacceptable to have stores selling items and agreeing delivery dates only for the route planners to then do what they want. They did say they could do it on 18 November but this was still not early enough for us so we cancelled the order.If this is how they operate now we will not be buying from them again.",2018-11-06

1712,5be1b5d89d37800b643dff57,"No wonder retail stores are dying after the shambles of an experience I had at your St Helen's Retail Park PC World I was shopping online at first, trying to purchase a i7 8th Gen laptop but after nearly ordering the system then said it wasnt in stock, no problem so I went to site (I should have never even bothered) I walk in, already aware of what I Want to buy (A Laptop that cost around £950) so I walk over, and ask where the i7's are. The people on the IT area, looked at each other as if id said something funny (you know, me being a customer to them) and they rather condescendingly told me that ""there isn't a specific area for i7's - they are scattered everywhere, just see what you want then buy it"" I let go the way I was spoken to (again, a paying customer - all I am expecting is for people to DO THEIR JOBS) SO after 25 minutes of browsing, after being spoken to like I was stupid I'd finally found a laptop that I Wanted (Again £960.00) I ask to buy it, to THEN be told its not in stock I ask them to see what they have in stock today, you know - because this is a retail store, and generally people like to walk out with the things they're about to spend near £1000The young lady then sighs audibly to me and my friends that I was with and says ""well I suppose I better check the stock"" I mean, is this unexpected that a customer service rep should actually know what they have in stock? have I, the customer done something wrong? She comes back, and then tells me that the only laptop they have in stock is a piece of garbage touchscreen HP, that even if I wanted - I couldn't walk out of the store, because this is a ""store model"" (I have purchased store models from PC world before, and I have never once been told that I must come back 24 hours later to pick it up.) So I explain to her, that all they have installed on this laptop is a demo video, with no username passwords, and no passwords or data on the device (I have already checked) she walks off, to ""speak with a manager"" who then comes back to say that it apparently takes +25 hours to reformat a laptop (That didn't need formatting, that had an SSD and an 8th grade i7 - so actually would have taken less than 30 minutes) So there I am, I wanted a laptop - from a store to take away with me, went to PC world's retail store and ended up just wasting 45 minutes of my time, talking to under-educated staff who clearly are not remotely interested in selling things to customers whilst this lady was off getting a list of reasons for why i couldn't take the store laptop, I'd already reserved one at Argos, at a cheaper price, at a better spec Moral of the story - stay away from dying pc world, that has snotty staff that dont actually want you to buy anything, they just want to waste your time and offer you abysmal service. There I was, ready to drop £1000 on a laptop there and then - when they let me walk away PC world do not seem interested in sales, or making money, or even - giving good, reputable customer servicebeyond a joke, and a complete waste of my time. will never buy anything from PC world again Signed, A very irritated computer engineer with more degrees in computing than two chubby salesmen that don't know what they are talking about.",2018-11-06

Back in the days, one could buy an item, the company would deliver as well as install for the customer. Further to this, the first customer service representative had the nerve to decline the small token of compensation that I asked for ( only 25% of actual spend).

Called up and waited for over an hour to speak to an engineer which in fact wasn't technically trained! He couldn't offer me any help whatsoever all he did was book an engineer to do a visit which I am going to have to take a full day of work unpaid to wait for the engineer to come and say that it's broken! How can a brand new dishwasher be broken if it's brand new!!! So then all you people will do is send out a replacement dishwasher. I wonder if this one will be broken also? And I will be losing a full days wages for the trouble! So in fact it's actually costing me money for you to deliver me broken appliances! How does that work out then?

1718,5be186af9d37800ac81d33fb,"I am absolutely disgusted with the service I have received from Currys. I ordered a fridge which stopped working 6 weeks after use, stopped cooling completely and everything in the fridge started filling with water. I called Currys to report this and was put through to the manufacturer, who said an engineer would have to come out – and they only offered appointments Monday to Friday, so I took a day off of work unpaid for the engineer to come out to me. Might I add, before doing this I was already told by the person on the phone at Beko that it was my fault that the fridge was broken, as I was meant to leave it 8 hours before turning it on when it was delivered, despite the fact the manual that came with the fridge says 4 hours! I told the person on the phone this and his response was “well it’s meant to be 8 hours”. Not a great start in general. When the engineer attended, he could see there was no food in the fridge as everything had been ruined. I showed him photographic evidence of the leaky fridge and the food which had been spoiled by condensation. He saw himself the amount of condensation in the fridge from the fridge rapidly heating up and then trying to cool again. At this point he tested the seal on the fridge and thought this seemed fine, so pulled the fridge out and replaced the control panel at the back of the fridge – he told me I would have to wait 24 hours to see if this worked. He admitted himself that he wasn’t sure what the issue was, so if this didn’t work I would have to call back to get another engineer out. With this still not successful I called back Beko twice to try and get this sorted, both of these times I was told the appointment would have be Monday to Friday, either a morning or afternoon appointment. I work full time and cannot physically take any more time off of work for this, I don’t see why I should have to lose money and get grief from my work if my fridge breaks after 6 weeks of use. I could understand if the fridge was a year old, or even 6 months old, but I cannot understand having to continuously lose money for a fridge that is faulty at 6 weeks.After this I sent an email to Currys complaining about the situation and was happy to receive a call back to rectify the situation, I explained the situation and the man who called said he would transfer me through to Beko to arrange an uplift number, then he would be able to arrange a collection and delivery at a time that suited me. As soon as I was put through to Beko I was told that this would not happen and an engineer would have to attend again. I explained the situation again to Beko for the lady on the phone to say “so your fridge hasn’t been working since the engineer originally attended and it’s taken you this long to call back?” (everyone I’ve spoken to at Beko has been incredibly rude and lacking customer service skills!), I explained that no this is not the case and I had actually called twice since, for her to tell me there was no record of those calls! I have records of calling Beko and can provide proof of this from my phone bill. She also told me that if the fridge was faulty on delivery they would replace it, however as I’d already had it 6 weeks it would not. I questioned her on whether it was normal for their fridges to break after 6 weeks, and if so clearly the fridges are awful quality, and she still didn’t really care. I ended this phone call as there was no way I could have an appointment booked in Monday to Friday and sent another email to Currys to complain about the awful service and overall awful experience dealing with Beko. After all, I purchased the fridge from Currys and NOT Beko so I didn’t really expect to have to deal with constant hassle from Beko. The reply I got from Currys to my email quite frankly made no sense, as it says that Beko will not arrange an uplift on the fridge until a fault has been verified with an engineer. This is where I’m confused. A fault HAS been verified already! An engineer HAS been out! It’s not my fault that he couldn’t figure out what the issue was, he said himself he could see that there was an issue with the fridge though! WHY does the email I have received from Currys said an uplift cannot be arranged until an engineer has attended the job when an engineer HAS already attended the job?? If he has reported something different to the fault that he saw himself and agreed that he saw, then I would like to read exactly what he has said, as I signed for the job based on the information that he told me! How many more days will I have to take off work before Beko finally agree to replace the fridge? It’s incredibly unreasonable that people are expected to lose money on more than one occasion in order to have an engineer attend the issue with absolutely no guarantee that anything can be sorted. As I have already said my fridge was 6 weeks old at the time it developed this fault, I am disgusted that I have purchased all of my large kitchen appliances from currys for them to treat a customer like this when an issue does occur. I would urge anyone to order their appliances through Hughes, as Hughes are truly customer based and will do anything to rectify a situation if a problem occurs. My boyfriend has also recently placed an order through currys for our new tumble dryer and IPhone which he will be cancelling as it’s disgusting that customers can be treated in this way.",2018-11-06

Once reaching the checkout stage, the only option presented is to pay now. It also states that ‘from time to time’ buy now, pay later offers are available. I phoned Currys, finally got transferred through to the correct department to be told, initially, that it has to be done in store. Once it was agreed that this could be done on line, I was told that he didn’t know why the website wouldn’t let ‘me personally’ take up the option. Whether it was James’ intention or not, I felt that there was an implied question about my credit worthiness. He told me to go to the shop and asked if I’d tried a different search engine. I told him I’d go to Amazon instead and then my jaw dropped as he said ‘we won’t miss your custom’ - twice because I thought I’d heard wrong the first time! The thing is Currys, you may not miss my custom, and I certainly won’t miss your ‘service’, but all the little people like me have a choice and if you treat too many of us like this, you will miss our money and your staff will miss their wages because they’ll be unemployed.

I did reply saying that this is caused by something inside the TV and not by human/external intervention, I have spoken to an independent repair company and they said its not worth paying to get it fixed as I might as well buy a new tv for the amount it would cost. I don't know if this currys PC World understands what Legal Obligation, I will be contacting Trading Standards (luckily its across the road from my office). The last email I had from them was a link to a Wikipedia page for ghosting and screen burn, ridiculous. I have posted my original post below. Original post. Bought a Samsung TV less than 2 years ago (it wasn't cheap) from the Hull store on Clough Road. Tv has burn marks down the middle and on the side, and they are unable to assist me.

I requested an early delivery 7am-11am thinking that everything was on ok. Delivery day, today!! Surprise, surprise I haven’t got the washing machine, it hasn’t been delivered. Checked online status, it showed “item ready to be dispatched” so I decided to ring their “famous” customer services. The “man on the line” said that the van stuck in traffic and he wasn’t sure when the washing machine would be delivered. It must be one of the oldest tricks in the book, so unprofessional!! Curry’s must have a training manual for staff full of rubbish excuses and other tricks so they can look them up if needed!! anyway when I mentioned the online delivery status he just simply said that I shouldn’t worry about that as that is not up to date. What??!! The man was quite sarcastic too as he said the truck stuck in traffic on M25 and then asked “you know M25 so it’s no surprise”. I have a strong feeling that the washing machine never going to be delivered and now I wonder if I’m going to get my money back from them. Avoid, avoid and avoid Currys!!

1758,5bdad64b9d3780077c23d5ab,"Dealing with this company has been the bane of my life for the past three weeks. I ordered an integrated dishwasher 5 weeks ago. It was delivered and installed the next week to our office on a day I was not there. When I returned to work I learned that the dishwasher had not worked since being installed and the engineer had not tested the machine before leaving. I called customer services, who arranged a pick up of the machine and delivery of a brand new one. Being in a busy office it is difficult to monitor everything, however, I do not expect the men working on behalf of Currys PC World Business to take the door (for the front of the integrated dishwasher which belongs to our kitchen) with them. I called customer services, told them what happened and they told me they would check with the warehouse if it had been brought in. After 3 days we both came to the conclusion that the door had been lost. They told me to source a new door and they will cover the cost. However they would not install the dishwasher then come out again to install the door. The week later I received the door and asked Currys PC World Business to please return and install it. The installation was booked in for a few days later - Friday 26th October. The engineer didn't turn up. It was then booked for Monday 29th October, the engineer didn't turn up. I was then eagerly promised that the engineer would come on Wednesday 30th October between 12:50 and 16:50. When the engineer had not turned up AGAIN between these times I called customer services AGAIN to which they said he was stuck in traffic and will be here in 30 mins. A staff member stayed in the office until 7pm and no one showed up. As you can probably imagine I am filled with frustration and rage by now as I can't quite fathom why this is so difficult. I have lost hours of work trying to sort out this menial task, our cleaner has had to stay longer to compensate for no dishwasher and staff have stayed after hours waiting for someone who never arrives. Today I have been promised, once again, that an engineer will come tomorrow however I have very little faith and cannot accept anymore lies. I have spoken to numerous customer service agents on the phone and over email (to which they have become ignored). This service is utterly disgusting and unacceptable. I can only assume, judging by your abundance of terrible reviews, you won't be in business too much longer.

They offered me to set up and delivery with the TV which I accepted for the following Friday. On Friday they rang me explaining to me that they can deliver the tv, however, won't have time to set up the tv. So a week later I received a phone call telling me that they were going to deliver my tv (even though I already had it) and knew nothing about setting up. So I was told I had a prime spot for the following Tuesday just to set up my tv. On that Tuesday they rang me again and knew nothing about setting up my tv which happened again that following Friday explaining to me that they didn't have the correct tools to set it up. Now at this point, we rang customer service and explaining our issue and they were extremely rude and unhelpful even refused to let me speak to the manager since I didn't have a good enough reason which is beyond a joke. On the following Tuesday (fifth time lucky) they finally managed to put the tv on my wall and set everything up but sadly when they left it started to turn off every 30 seconds. I rang the tech support team and spent 40 minutes trying to figure out the issue and he said it was the network card and it would need to be replaced but he set everything up for me and all I needed to do is speak to the delivery team to organize a time for the replacement. When I was transferred I gave them some sort of code and they told me I had to drive to PC world before they close that night! When I got there the store was really good again and organized a prime slot again since it was their mess up. When they came to replace the tv they realized midway that it was the wrong model (it was an older version) and they spent over 5 minutes trying to get me to keep the wrong tv even though I paid for a better one which was just disgusting. After they left I went to the store again and spoke to the manager which sent an email out to someone to organize the delivery to my house with the correct tv and set it up. Finally, they have set it up correctly and it works perfectly fine however it was just a simple cable which was the issue which wasted my time and the stores. THEN the next day I get a phone call telling me that my replacement tv is on its way and they had no record of it already being delivered. So after all that I have sent an email out to complain and the store has opened a case to get some money.

I explained it all to him and he advised that he would deal with it. Whilst he was going to get it from the stock room I was told to go to the desk to go through the trading in (trading in an old tablet).When I approached this desk I was greeted by the most miserable and unhelpful member of staff you could imagine. after checking his watch he told me that the systems were down and to come back in tomorrow as they were closing and wanted to go home. In the meantime the gentleman came back from the stock room with the tablet and asked the gentleman to check the system again for the trade in. After he checked his watch again and gave another sigh it was back up and working again surprisingly.With vouchers in hand we then proceeded to the tills to pay for the item. They had taken the payment off the 2 gift card which I gave them however the remaining balance which I was paying off using a card would go through due to one of there systems being down. I was then told that they couldn't do anything that night and they wanted to go home and that I had to go back in the following day.They voided the transaction and advised that the money would go back on to the gift cards within 24-48hrs (so I wouldn't have been able to go back in the following day). I rang the customer services number yesterday (30th Oct and spoke to a very helpful gentleman. After explaining to him all of the above and telling him I needed it for a gift for the 31st Oct he advised he would email the store and regional manager and ask them to call me straight away with a solution and to offer a gesture of goodwill or a discount on the product for all of the inconvenience.Guess what.... I didn't get a call and more than 24hrs on, I still haven't. oh, and I still haven't got the money on the gift cards (more than 48hrs now).I have just called the customer services again and he called the store to find out what's happening. Store advised it wasn't dealt with and they have just actioned it and that it was now going to be another 48hrs.I explained to the guy in customer services that this wasn't good enough and that I needed the item today (now) and he just kept saying there was nothing he could do about it. I asked to speak to a manager and he declined to pass it over and said he wouldn't want to speak to me. When I asked for his name so I could write a complaint he refused to give it.Absolutely appalling service and I will certainly not be using them again.

It was very lucky that my sister was there at that time as once they delivered the new washing machine they were leaving when my sister asked them about recycling the old one when the guy said ""oh are we supposed to take it?"" The youngster with him looked at his sheet and said ""oh yeah!"" Well I think that they would have left my mothers house leaving the old one behind. Do you think that common sense would be for your delivery drivers to check their delivery sheets and also to txt when they are arriving???? My mother is a vulnerable OAP and would not have thought about the recycling payment. I am extremely angry and think that what you pay for you should receive as standard so train your delivery men PLEASE!!!!",2018-10-31
1766,5bd9b70b9d37800bcc54de87,"I bought a PC in August last year. Not long before the guarantee ran out this year I had a problem with one of the fans - it was noisy and I kept getting a warning every time the pc was turned on. I called customer service and they managed to get rid of the warning sign. However, I was not convinced it was fully repaired as there was still a noise coming from the pc and expressed my concern that the guarantee was nearly up. I was assured that as the problem was now registered with customer services then even if it ran out of guarantee they would repair it and not to worry. The problem has continued intermittently getting worse until recently when I called PC World quite confident that they would repair this ongoing fault. However, quite cunningly PC world have a policy, which I was told they were under no obligation to inform the public of, whereby if a customer does not call within 7 days about a recurring problem then the complaint and problem is treated as a new one and they are therefore under no obligation to repair it. Feel completely duped by PC World to the point where I feel that I was even manipulated into letting it run out of guarantee to avoid any expense on their part. Not wanting anything to do with PC World I have had it fixed independently. The engineer was appalled as the fan should have lasted a lot longer than 11-12 months. The engineer stated that he hears constant complaints about PC World Customer Service and recommended buying any electrical items from elsewhere.",2018-10-31
1767,5bd99bc79d3780077c2367dd,"Summer 18 - We had a fridge breakdown which was nearly 6 years old from curry’s and had taken out the 7 day repair or replace insurance at £5 per month. This was paid over nearly 6 years, £345.00 to be exact.Fridge was inspected 2 days after report of fault and booked in for a repair, new mains board.The following Tuesday came and went with no repairman to be seen, after endless hours of calls we were told the fridge repair engineer would be back on Friday (outside the 7 day agreement) and questioned this only to be told “unfortunately” we can’t offer you a replacement.Friday comes and the engineer turns up to repair fridge now broken for 9 days, he enters the house and asks what’s wrong with it and it turned out he was only here to diagnose what was wrong???????? Not repair.So we then spent another half a day trying to get a replacement and they reluctantly agreed.Attempted to deliver 3 times, moving dates and just not showing up. The best being the delivery driver stood at the top of our drive shouting “FOR F**** SAKE”October 18 - After a new house move we replaced all of our appliances, we went with AO who were superb, we had to order a dishwasher from curry’s due to the colour and the product being exclusive to them.Again, 3 failed deliveries and hours spent on the phone trying to sort this mess out.Refunds take 3/5 days but the money flies out of your account in seconds.This company cannot deliver what they promise or what you buy in the time agreed.Cannot for the life of me understand how they are still in business.Go to AOIn response to your reply it’s pointless me wasting any more time.

1769,5bd8bfe09d37800bcc54940e,"I have been reduced to having to resort to social media to report the shocking service I have received from Currys/Knowhow/Miele as each time I call up I am unable to be put through to a senior management person who has the common sense, knowledge or authority to make a decision. I have called up 5 times today in sheer frustration and the person at the other end of the line in the call centre absolutely point blank refuses to put me through to anyone senior. I am just told that I will be told the same thing by anyone else.I bought a top of the range £1,500.00 MIELE - G6890SCVi K2O Full-size Integrated Dishwasher in February 2017, it has a 2 year guarantee. A few months ago we started noticing a black film on all the plastic inside the dishwasher (the salt container, cutlery trays, framework etc). Any plastic parts inside the empty dishwasher that should look white are all now coated in dirty grey mould, and getting dirtier and dirtier as time goes on. I was using the proper “Finish” tablets and rinse aid, replenishing when the light came on to tell me to do so, I was cleaning the filter regularly. My worry is that if this residue is visible on the plastic inside the dishwasher, what residue has been left on my “clean” dishes that we are eating off every day?I called Currys, who put me on to Know How, who arranged an engineer visit for 2 and a half weeks’ time. I was to be without a dishwasher for 2 and a half weeks! The engineer was unable to identify what was causing this grey residue and he made a few calls to his superiors whilst he was standing in my kitchen trying to establish what it could be. They suggested putting a cup of vinegar on a hot wash in the dishwasher and hopefully that would remove the residue. The only explanation they could come up with between them, was that this was caused by the silver cutlery I occasionally put in the dishwasher. I was vehemently informed, and it was stressed by the engineer AND his superior on the other end of the line, that under no circumstances whatsoever should I ever put silver in the dishwasher and that dishwashers were not designed to take silver. I assured them that this was not the case, as I had had the cutlery for over 11 years, and had used it many times in my previous Hotpoint dishwasher and had never had this problem. I also had the 80 page Miele instruction booklet to hand and search for the part where it mentions that silver shold not be used in the dishwasher. There is a long list of items such as wooden cutlery and crockery, antiques and valuable glassware, copper brass tin and aluminium, etc etc. NO MENTION ANYWHERE that silver could not go in the dishwasher. The only mention made of silver was: “Please note: Silverware previously cleaned with a silver polish may still be damp or spotted at the end of a programme, where water has not run off smoothly. It may need to be rubbed dry with a soft cloth. Silver which has been in contact with foods containing sulphur can discolour. These include egg yolk, onions, mayonnaise, mustard, pulses, fish, fish brine and marinades.” NO MENTION ANYWHERE THAT SILVER WILL LEAVE A MOULDY BLACK RESIDUE THROUGHOUT THE INSIDE OF THE DISHWASHER.I showed this to the engineer, who had now run out of ideas, and then adapted his claim and stated that it must be my particular cutlery set (the same particular one that I have been using for over 11 years and never had a problem with) and that I should get in touch with them and find out if it had been correctly treated. Being an extremely efficient person, I handed him the Arthur Price brochure which states clearly on the first page: “DishwashersAll of our cutlery is dishwasher safe. Simply use a gentle, good-quality detergent and make sure the rinse aid is topped up (detergents and rinse aids with lemon are not recommended).”He then swiftly asked me what rinse aid I was using. I whipped out my “Finish shine and protect rinse aid” from under the sink. At this stage he said he was going to file his report, and someone from Miele would get in touch with me. That was last Wednesday the 24th October (a week ago). So I have been without a dishwasher for over 3 weeks.So today I made the 5 phone calls, and each the person in the call centre REFUSED to put me through to a senior person or escalate my matter, because they could read in front of them that the engineer has logged on his call out that the problem is a “maintenance issue” and there is no fault with the dishwasher!I am now left with a £1,500.00 dishwasher that I cannot use for fear of contaminating my family, Miele have no idea what is causing this and as far as they are concerned the matter is now closed.I find it unacceptable that Currys / Knowhow / Miele have washed their hands of a defective product, because even if this is a “maintenance issue” (whatever that means), they are still unable to tell me how to fix it, as the vinegar method did not make any change.UPDATE: 1 November 2018Further to my review above, I have just received this email from Knowhow. The gist of it is that I spend £1,500.00 on a top of the range Miele dishwasher, there is black mould throughout the interior of the machine, the engineer does not know what is causing this and has no solution as to how to fix the problem so lists it as a ""maintenance issue"" - basically because he DOES NOT KNOW. Because he has logged this as a ""maintenance issue"", they will not take it back or even offer to take it away to investigate and repair it. Basically it is MY PROBLEM and if I want to get an independent engineer out at my own expense to investigate this is my prerogative. So advice to anyone contemplating buying anything from Currys - be prepared for no after sales care whatsoever. Stick with purchasing from either John Lewis or Costco as they will follow through with aftercare. Incidentally, at the same time as purchasing the £1,500 dishwasher (which is not even 2 years old), I purchase an American Fridge Freezer, so total spend over £4,000.00 (not to mention countless other purchases over the years) and this is the way they treat a valued customer.Dear Mrs C,Thank you for getting back to us with your information and the trust pilot review. Reviewing the situation Miele are the point of contact in regards for any faults and repairs that you wish to have fixed, as they have reported there is no fault with the machine and it is a maintenance issue causing the residue you have reported we would be unable to issue a refund or write off for the appliance.Looking into what steps can be taken next you can try enquiring to a third party repairer to look into the residue present in the machine to see if it is connected to a fault within the machine. If this can be found we can look further into repairing this fault found for you. As this was reported as a ""maintenance issue"" similar to what the Miele engineer reported its possible something being put into the machine is causing this residue. From a quick search regarding your issue it appears to not be uncommon for residue to build up over time in dishwashers. There are many guides on the best methods to get rid of this residue and what steps can be taken to help prevent future build ups. I understand this might not be the outcome you were expecting and apologies, currently the best option is to have another engineer look into the device (This can mean additional charges if no fault is found) or follow any appropriate guides from trusted sources which explain the best method for cleaning the build up of residue.Kind regardsBen S1502283044748_tkh.JPGTEAM KNOWHOW - Social MediaTEAM KNOWHOW Customer Contact Centre",2018-11-01
1770,5bd88dc99d37800bcc5479c5,"The worst service I have ever received is with Curry's. This is the first time I have ever complained. Paid for a good delivery time and installation of a dishwasher. Delivery was 2 and a half hours late and installer had a bad attitude. Started to get puddles of water on the floor, not from dishwasher but from the installation, called many times, was on hold for 40 minutes and always passed on to someone else, very frustrating to deal with customer services whilst in a full time job. Managed to book someone to come over but brought a large van and couldn't get to me even though I has said they needed to bring a small van due to narrow road on first visit. Suggested parking and walking up the road with tools but driver said that wasn't an option. Re-booked after several phone calls and put on hold, same thing happened! This time the driver said he would talk to his boss and call back but never did. I have since emailed the CEO twice and customer services who told me they tried to call and didn't get through and that the matter had been resolved?!?! I had no missed calls and the installation is still leaking! I would never use this company again, still waiting for a response or phone call from customer services. Would like to return the dishwasher but can't bear to be on hold any longer to organise it!Just to update, still no reply from Curry's having emailed them on the contact email provided in their response",2018-11-01

1773,5bd85bcd9d37800bcc545e62,"What a faff dealing with Currys and their staff - their customer service is nothing like it is advertised on their website! I went to the Cardiff store to buy a TV. All the TVs had an advertisement of 24 months interest free finance, so I queried about this and was told that it didn't apply to the TVs I was looking at and it was a general advertisement. So this offer didn't apply to about 30+ TVs yet was being advertised on them?I queried about the 50h TVs as nearly all of them were 50h, not an ideal 60h and asked how it would perform with a gaming console. I was told by two staff that this 2018, 50h, 43 inch TV would not be able to display a game very well. However my, over a decade old, brick of a television worked fine with my gaming console so I knew this wasn't correct information. A quick Google search put my mind at ease and a realisation that they were trying to make me doubt the TV and purchase a more expensive one. As I suspected, the TV works perfectly fine with my gaming console and the console and HDMI cable boosts it up to 60h anyway. It seems the staff are either tricking people who aren't tech savvy or are genuinely not kept up to speed with basic technology information. Buying the telly was the biggest ordeal. Everyone we spoke to seemed tired and not at all enthusiastic. We felt like we were being a hindrance. I enquired about the finance options and before I knew it, he was signing me up to it before asking me first and talking me through it and letting me decide whether I wanted finance or not. About three times, we mentioned that we weren't sure about finance and that it'd be less hassle to just pay immediately. The man was rushing us through it and then said that I'd been accepted and that we basically couldn't go back on it now. We both expressed our anxieties to him, asking him questions about the finance agreement, hidden charges etc. but he just kept saying ""don't worry"", not thinking that maybe we're concerned because he's barely explained anything to us and rushed us into a finance agreement. He then abruptly muttered that there's insurance on it which I believed was part of the deal, but he said it would be £3.99 a month. He never mentioned insurance or asked me if I wanted it. I asked him how to cancel it and he said ""you'll see a direct debit, just cancel that."" How about ask me first if I want insurance and not chuck it on me to gain yourself commission?! So today I've had to ring up the insurance people to cancel it and have had to sort out payments and direct debits - so much hassle!! And I asked for a confirmation e-mail of my payment from Creation (yes, you have to ask for one) and I never received one so I've had to take screenshots of everything to prove my purchase.Instead of leaving the store feeling excited and happy, I was wondering if I'd done the right thing; I felt confused and tricked. It really put a dampener on the whole experience and joy of buying a new gadget.I would recommend only visiting Currys to see TV quality, then buying the TV elsewhere.",2018-10-30

I don’t want the money from them, they can keep their dirty money. What I wanted is for them to apologise for all the problems they caused. The company hasn’t got a decent thing about it. They lie and cheat with zero customer service. You can’t speak to anyone in the complaints department, just request a call back that never comes.

Phoned Currys and told to take it back to store which we did. Politely asked for a refund and was told, very rudely, that a refund was out of the question. When I asked why was told it was up to Hoover whether to repair, replace or refund. I patiently explained that as the Retailer my contract was with Currys - the salesperson agreed but still insisted on phoning Hoover. They said they would send a new part for it but it's obvious the product isn't fit for purpose. So that's £170 down the drain - something we can ill afford as we are both disabled and therefore money is tight. In the past I've had many things from Currys - but never again. Today we were kept waiting nearly 30 minutes just to be seen - in the end I had to ask for a chair as I was in so much pain from standing.

This was another waited hour whilst between 4 colleagues they worked out what they needed to do. I left the store being told i would be contacted the next day to book installation. No phone call so another call from me only to be told they didn't have a contact number for me - i could see it on the invoice in front of me that had been keyed into the system !

Take a look at DV80M50133X from AO.com It's an identical machine including colour at £30 cheaper than your companies, but their item number cannot match your unique number as it's unique to your company. Therefore I cannot match an identical part number and qualify for the price match promise. Please tell me what is different about this machine apart from the item number! I gave your company a 2 star review rating because that means 'an inadequate experience with a lot of friction' which I feel is a fair rating. Your customer service operator told me to go back to the store he had just spoken to on the phone which was a 12 mile round trip where I would be issued with the £50 refund.

They explained that delivery would be done all night because of the delay, if we didn't get the fridge to call up in the morning.At 20:20 I decided to have a look on track and to my surprise it is saying that the order is being process and I will get a notification for when it will be dispatched the estimated delivery states the 23rd on Tuesday, I am at work from Monday to Friday what the hell, no notification no email or text.Paid full in stored like take my money and then treat customers like second class citizens.

They suggested I can get an external company and claim the money from Currys, I thought Currys is now being reasonable, but NO, because the person could not confirm this to me in writing. I asked how to claim the money and when will I get the money back, the person could not provide details and introduced the concept of reasonable amount - I asked how much does Currys consider resoable, the person could not provide a number and said depends on location, service, and product - when I told him you already know the product (I bought it from Currys), the location (your team delivered and installed it) and service (installation), he still couldnt not tell what is reasonable.

Sarah who sold me the machine and arranged all the details was really friendly and and knowledgeable.

Because it was so late in the day, the delivery guys said the earliest they could deliver a new one would be the following day, but they couldn't even give a delivery time, so I had to take a day off to wait home. Sunday morning, A SECOND DAMAGED MACHINE WAS DELIVERED. I can understand once, but surely on attempt number 2, you'd check the product before delivering??? Apparently not. I asked for the replacement to be brought out that afternoon but for some reason this was not possible. I'd need to take yet another day off and wait for a THIRD machine to be delivered on Monday, which I agreed to, mostly because I'm pretty much out of clean clothes so I need the machine as soon as possible. At this point I went back in to Currys to talk to a manager. Despite asking twice, no one got a manager for me. Whether the manager refused to see me, or the sales persons didn't pass on my request, I don't actually know. After explaining the situation, the sales person I talked to didn't offer any resolution, didnt apologize for the situation and put it back on me to suggest what was to be done. Clearly they've put a lot of effort into the soft skills required for sales, but nothing into complaint resolution.

1838,5bcafc579d378004f0202c5d,Wouldn’t even give them one star if I had a choice! NEVER buy a TV from here!!! They are shoddy goods!!! Ours just wouldn’t turn on after only 9 months and guess what - they wouldn’t even fix it because they smashed it up whilst it was in curry’s possession and are saying they didn’t do it!!!!!!! These are like the dodgy market traders you avoid only in a big posh shop. Absolutely disgusting behaviour and badly made goods!!!!! Go to a reputable dealer and keep your money safe. The Newark repairs centre are a bunch of liars!!! Someone there knows exactly what they did to our tv and won’t admit to it! They also conveniently lost the paperwork signed at pick up stating the tv screen had no damage to it! That’s what you get when dealing with this company - liars! thieves! vandals!! And yes you guessed it I am reporting this to trading standards and I am going to see what a legal representative has to say about it too.,2018-10-28

When I got home and checked my receipt in more detail, I realised the shop assistant had charged £80 to my bank card for two products that I would never need. I complained firstly to Customer Service telephone line and then I spoke to the store manager. Neither were very helpful. The store Manager only agreed to refund the money after I threatened to return the goods. It’s unfortunate because I had planned on spending more money on kitchen appliances and a telly for Christmas, but this experience completely shattered my trust in the store.

We paid !£85 to remove the old one and fit the new. £20 for a specific time sllot as we needed to take time ioff work to be with her. The cooker arrived when unpacked it was dented. The delivery guys were very apologetic and offered 20% off for us. Due to the location of the dent which was quite noticeable we declined the offer and asked how soon we could have a replacment as we needed the cooker urgently and had paid for the time slot and also taken time off work. The guy explained that time slots for gas fitting should not be paid for as times could not be allocated at the depot yet currys are still charging customers for a service that does not exist!! He then explained that he had the identical cooker on the van which was going back to the warehouse which if the depot agreed they would happily fit for us . He made the call and then informed us that he was not allowed to fit the exact same cooker from his van and we ended up booking another cooker and another sllot for two days later with a time slot that in realluty cannot be honoured as the system for booking it does not exist. Leaving an elderly lady with no cooker and having to use another days annual leave . The whole system needs looking at it. It is a very poor customer service.

Their downfall is the huge lack of customer service, and I know this as fact having actually worked at a Currys.As a customer, you will have an assistant always trying to sell you things like their care plan or their extremely overpriced HDMI cables. This is because the assistants are required to do this in order to keep their jobs, they have targets to hit.As an employee, it was more important to sell accessories for a TV than the actual TV. I was told to sway the customer towards a cheaper TV in order to sell them more accessories such as cables/speakers/bluray players/tv stands/aerials etc. This is because the margins on the accessories are greater.Your job as an employee of Currys PCWorld is to make as much money out of a customer as possible, which is completely fair, but that means convincing people to buy things they don't want or need. Employees will blatantly lie to customers just to make a sale.If a customer buys a product without any accessories or a care plan, it is referred to as a ""dead sale"" and they would rather you didn't purchase anything at all.This is my first had experience of working for Currys.

It's a very poor call centre which takes ages to get through multiple options, and then has you on hold for ages. First call dropped due to my mobile signal; they didn't bother calling me back. Second call took a total of 25mins to deal with and involved me telling the whole story from scratch.The only saving grace was that they agreed to throw in the installation service for free (I had planned to install myself when I was visiting the property over the weekend), and luckily my neighbour had a spare key and was available to let them into the property whilst I was 400 miles away.Overall, it would have been better if they kept their side of the bargain and honoured the agreed delivery date.

However, Curry's offering 1/2 price installation @£45, I paid for installation feeling confident a qualified electrician would be installing the oven...not so, the oven arrives with 2 guys who took my existing electric oven out to fit the new one to be told I need a qualified electrician. I said I have paid for installation by a qualified electrician so your taking out old electric oven, it has its own fuse box and wirering. No the wirering is different, but you are a qualified electrician and installation means you have what you need to install the electric oven. Got nowhere with that and they left. I rang knowhow (knownothowto) explained and was told I needed to have the work done prior to fitting. No amount of explaining could they understand that they were replacing electric oven with electric oven...I said again to be told they are not qualified electricians but engineers? Got an qualified electrician to fit the oven, took old oven out fitted the new oven using the same wirering. This has cost my £95.Let's move on to the washing machine, well, yes delivered I paid for installation. They take the old inset washing machine out and the dishwasher to get to the pipes. We can't fit the new washing machine as I need a builder to put the waste pipe in, what I said, your taking out fit new one I don't understand, they went outside showed me where the waste pipe could be visited by making a hole in the wall leading the new pipe to the drain. Even I know they are talking rubbish. Rang knowhow who booked me in for installation again. They came on the day they said with extended hosepipes fitted washing machine then they said can't fit the kitchen unit door as they need biscuits to fit so they can drill different holes I rang knowhow said you need to order these parts (why should I order the parts. It should be them ordering them). Again back onto knowhow who order the parts. THey some weeks later Iafter i got a text saying got thee parts coming to fit. They did fit the kitchen unit door on but quests what the door doesn't fitted properly and as the took the dishwasher out to get to the pipes the dish washer was not refitted propley and makes a strongClicking noise.Now fridge, inset fridge, easy take out refit new fridge, yes good, but don't have the parts to refit the unit door to the fridge.

There's no damage at all to the blender. I don't buy a product to expect it to break within two months. When I approached Curry's for a refund or exchange, they refused.

1871,5bc5e6ce9d378004f01e7203,"What a terrible inefficient company.I am copying below a letter which I have just sent to Currys in reply to an email which I wrote last Thursday in connection with the purchase of a Belling dual fuel range cooker which needed a LPG conversion kit. In fact I have just had an automated email today acknowledging this which informs me they will respond in up to seven days. I am let wondering what happens in the meantime??Thank you for your email received this morning 16th October.It is a pity that you did not read and acknowledge my email to your department of Thursday 11th October when I stated that the cooker I had ordered, and quoted my reference number for the purchase of it, needed to be supplied with a LPG kit. If you had made allowance for this on your on-line order form this request could have been dealt with. In fact it was a complete waste of my time writing to you.As I had not received a reply to my request I telephoned Currys on Friday afternoon the 12th October. Having waited for a very long time to be connected to your department I was told that I had the wrong department and was transferred to 'Deliveries’. After another very long wait I was eventually connected to a female, and after having explained the situation to her, she very quickly advised that this would be no problem and rang off.On Sunday I received a text message advising that the cooker would be with me the following day which was Monday. I tried again three times to advise that it was a LPG and needed a kit but unfortunately your message was automated and would not receive a reply.On Monday the cooker duly arrived and I asked the person delivering it, and apparently the one who was going to instal, if he knew that it was LPG. He had no knowledge of this at all, said he could not install it and subsequently took it back to Newark.I am absolutely furious at this shoddy service from a company as large as Currys. Appointments were cancelled to facilitate the delivery and installation of my new cooker. Apologies are not good enough - I want some action to install the cooker at a time suitable to myself.I have no intention of once again phoning your sales team. You offer to install the cooker for which I am paying you to do, therefore, it is up to you to make sure the correct kit is ordered and the appropriate installer is despatched.I look forward to receiving your repl",2018-10-16

Let me put it like this. When the idea of keeping a £500 fridge that doesn't work just so you don't have to deal with Currys anymore is something you find yourself entertaining, then you've reached the maximum level of poor customer service.I honestly didn't think companies were like this any more.Will never buy from them again.",2018-10-16

1876,5bc53ed89d378009bc81644d,"Earlier this year I bought a tumble dryer from Currys for my mother. it was on special offer as an ex shop display model. When it was delivered I was not there and when I looked for the instruction manual later it was not with the machine. My mother said it was unboxed just wrapped in bubble wrap when it came. I opened the door and water poured out ! I went back to the shop to get the manual and was told by the first salesperson I saw "" I don't know anything about this "" ? and she passed me over to a guy who also "" did'nt know anything about this "" ? He disappeared to ask someone else and then came back and directed me to the Customer Care desk who "" did'nt know anything about instruction manuals "" ? But they could print one off for me. This consisted of about 50 A4 loose pages... not very good ! I told them water had leaked from the door and the girl said "" Oh its probably been stood in the yard ""! So not impressed with Currys I said I wanted my money back which they refunded and the machine was being collected the next day. The "" Know How "" van duly came the next day to collect it and I told the driver what had gone on. He pulled the machine out examined it and said "" Its secondhand I can tell, did'nt you notice the big dent in the side as well , we collect this stuff all the time Currys are famous for it, it will just go back and be resold as ex demo model again "" I then bought another dryer elswhere. My latest whinge with Currys happened last week when I bought a JVC Freeview Play tv from the same branch. I really did not want to go there at all but unfortunetly where I live there is very little choice as regards tv retailers. The salesman said I could have it fully installed and demonstrated for £45. "" Is that everything including Internet I asked "" "" Everything "" said the guy . So it was arranged for Tuesday 9th October to be delivered. They called me that day to say they were 20 minutes away so as I was out I set off home to meet them. It took me about 15 minutes to get home but my wife said they had been and it was ""all done"". I thought it was quick so I asked her how long they were here. "" About 3 minutes "" she said. Apparantly they lifted they old tv out of the way put the new one in place, plugged it in and connected the aerial, switched it on and said "" there you go love all done "" and left. No Internet programmed in, no proper demo of how the tv worked...nothing ! In fact my wife said they knew nothing at all about the tv . In fact the tv was still in "" Store Mode "" I eventually figured it all out and got everything working So £45 for 3 minutes work, I don't think so. I went back to the shop and got the £45 refunded. I hate Currys with a passion. Their service is appalling and I think they get away with it because they seem to be the only national electrical superstore left now. I would strongly advise anyone to steer well clear if you possibly can. Carl Ireland Hull",2018-10-16

Finally got the the delivery date and the original date was supposedly no longer available and I now had to wait a week and a half for delivery. Shortly afterwards I received a text to confirm delivery for a completely different day! I called Currys to confirm the date. The text I received was incorrect but I continued to receive update texts to confirm the wrong delivery date. The date of the correct delivery date came and I received a text to say the delivery would be between 3-7pm. The delivery guys showed up at 1.30pm and thankfully I had just got home to receive the delivery. They guys were really polite but annoyingly the washing machine had a massive dent in so installation could not be complete. A rep phoned me to rearrange delivery for two days later but there was no real apology and no compensation regarding the fact I have to lose another days work to stay in for delivery. Save yourself the hassle and go to somewhere else! Oh and god forbid that you need to call them, you will be in a never ending automated system queue and then after going through the endless options and listening to irrelevant information you will be cut off! Impossible to speak with anyone...but they want it that way that once they've got your money. update: I've emailed as per the response below.....no reply! However, I managed to speak with someone via Currys Facebook page who I asked to call me. I was informed a replacement washing machine was being delivered on Friday so 10 days after I made my initial order. The annoying thing about this is that I was originally told the washing machine would be delivered on Wednesday and not Friday therefore, I would have waited in for nothing because no one from the depot had bothered to tell me they had changed the delivery date!

When I contacted them (which is not easy, and the call staff seem to be defensive rather than helpful), I was told that the order was being referred to some kind of review, which they hadn't bothered to contact me about. In other words, I could have gone elsewhere if I had known there was an issue with the order, but their online business is not set up to advise customers of this, and thereby wastes time, effort and goodwill.

She ignored me twice and then couldn't even type a number into the computer and i think she was mute because she did not speak one word to me or respond even when i walked away or at any point during my visit. I'm all for giving opportunity to people but it has to be fit for purpose. All i asked was if a particular model was out on display. She was actually just trying and failing to type the code (FOUR times it was painful) which i gave her back into the Currys website.

We had a faulty washing machine Currys refused to take responsibility for - luckily the manufacturer stepped in to fix the issue and apologised on behalf of Currys. My laptops concurrent problems... well! Polite members of staff would be nice. To actually carry out the repair specified on the sheet would also be nice. Every 6 months or so goes in for the same repair. I'm informed it's from mis use.... which is extremely bizarre as after the first incident it's now in a strong belkin case and carrier... with no signs of mis use. Just an awful computer clearly fixed with cheap parts that repetitively break. 2 years of constant problems most company's would have offered some kind of good will gesture. Not team know how. Just get a very rude northern woman with an attitude problem where the customer is clearly the biggest inconvience to her day. To be honest. I've given up on my fight and battle. How Currys are still legally trading is beyond me.... perhaps there not.... only time will tell. John Lewis or ao.com is the way forward... they sell everything Currys does and more.

When everything was packaged myself with a friend and it was thoroughly checked to ensure all contents were inside the box before sealing the box up so in other words Currys are liars! Furthermore, I was accused of lying about the fault on the TV when I was happy to show a footage that I captured as my back up, but they refused to see it so that was on them not me. So to wrap up this review my advice to anyone that reads this; please steer clear of this company and pay the odds for the same item elsewhere and save yourself from the grief this company gives you. It is very surprising that Currys are still trading with the amount of bad reviews and poor sales practices etc. I will also mention this here that an employee from Currys told me he hates his job, poor management, staff unfriendly, lie to customers to meet your targets it goes on...I gave him honest advice to get out and get a better job.On a side note, I hate that I have to leave one star because that's being too generous for this company! Zero stars would be more fitting but ah well what can you do?",2018-10-10
1909,5bbe5f339d3780075c58140c,Been waiting 9 weeks for a loan tv to become available and after endless phone calls and e-mails have got absolutely nowhere. Our tv was broken whilst in for another repair however we still have to wait on a long list. This is totally disgusting service or i should say no customer service at all. We have now given in and set a new repair date leaving us once again without a tv for at least 5 days. We have had no apologies and every e-mail received from currys has only ever been an automated one saying complaint being lookef into but never hear anything back. There is absolutely no way we shall ever shop at currys pc world again!!! Disgusting!!,2018-10-10

1911,5bbe11ac9d3780075c57ea1a,"Ordered Pure F3 DAB/Bluetooth radio to be delivered to store.Store handed over item fine, but got it home and the box had been opened and bashed around a DPD van by the look of it. As it was a Xmas gift, I e-mailed CPCW and after three days of no reply to my mail called them to get an exchange. They arranged a collection (all fine and good) and days later tell me it is no longer available after they've had it back. All in an e-mail that doesn't even give the order number (which you are asked for when you call them). Called them back and asked for the one they are listing on eBay as ""pristine in sealed packaging"" (I have the screenshot). They can't do that. Offered an item of similar value (thanks!) but they don't have anything of the same spec or near. Then told only option is a refund, which would be fine if I hadn't bought the item with a gift card through my NHS association. So now I have a gift card for £130 I can't use because CPCW can't supply the item they took the order for. And they won't recompense me for the gift card either so I am not out of pocket to buy it elsewhere which would be the morally right thing to do. My recent experience of CPCW is one of hit and miss service and an lack of ability to compromise. I've raised a complaint (CC3809633) and was told I ""might"" get a reply. What sort of organisation can ignore a complaint when the customer is aggrieved at being mis-lead and ripped off? Update: After a further review by CPCW... no change. Still no radio, no cash refund to enable me to buy elsewhere and no meaningful action.",2018-10-11

1913,5bbdd6479d3780034449326e,"This review is an update on a previous one (entitled Mis-selling or Fraud?) that I posted at the weekend. The situation detailed has now been resolved 100% to my satisfaction and I am delighted. I would like to acknowledge the support that I received from the staff at Currys PC World in Galashiels. By helping to turn this situation round, the Galashiels staff have not only retained a long-standing customer, they have also ensured positive word-of-month from me for the Currys brand, including this five-star rated review. Although I’m making special mention in this case of Steve, Chris, Reece and Robbie, because their handling of the issues involved was exemplary customer service, I would like to add that the assistance I get in this store has always been excellent.I would also like to thank ‘Rachel’ from ‘LetUsKnow’, the customer care department that responds to posts about Currys / Team Knowhow on Trustpilot. Rachel reviewed my complaint and escalated it to the right level, which enabled the situation to be quickly resolved.It’s a great pity that the same level of satisfaction cannot be said of Team Knowhow’s first level customer service, in their call centre, where I had the misfortune to encounter ‘Grant’. His attitude and behaviour directly led to my previous post on Trustpilot and, therefore, he is not included in this five-star rating. However, further comment on that will be reserved to an update on Trustpilot's Team Knowhow link, rather than on one that includes the store.",2018-10-10

Can't replace it for 3 weeks...I ordered my tumble dryer last week and had to take half a day off work to wait in for it (not a surprise, and I'm happy to live with that, but still an annoyance!) But they delivered it this morning and promptly left without unpacking it (which I didn't mind at the time, but it becomes relevant later)Planning to unpack and install it when I got home, I left for work, and when I got home I unpacked it only to find that it had a massive dent in the front. I rang Currys, was put through to Hoover. waited nearly an hour, and was then told that I actually needed to ring Currys (who I'd rung in the first place!)Rang Currys again and finally got to speak to a human, who rudely told me that since t was a store purchase, I'd have to go in store to do anything about it...As you can imagine, I wasn't dreadfully impressed by this point, so I drove all the way down to the store who then told me that while they would replace it, they couldn't do so for 3 weeks...So... That's 4 weeks from my original order date then... And I'll have to take another half day off work for the second delivery... Oh Currys... I didn't expect the earth... Just you to deliver a tumble dryer, but it's now cost me half a day off work, an hour on the phone, another hour to drive to Currys and back...

Tried it in various different sockets and the same issue every time. Called Currys and they asked if it had been installed by a professional (it's a tumble dryer!!!!). They then said it must be our electrics and we need to get an electrician out. Sounded unlikely, but got an electrician to come round and he confirmed the electrics are fine and it was most likely a dead short or faulty mains relay switch on the dryer. Called customer services, but closed at 5.30pm, so went back to the store. Big queue at customer services, so tried to speak to a couple of workers who seemed to have nothing to do apart from play with each others hair and they told me I'd need to go to customer services. Person at customer services called the same number as I did and got the same message (lines closed at 5.30pm). Told me to call them in the morning. Had to make 7 phone calls before getting someone to help. Eventually got through Jessica who, within 10 minutes had called me back and arranged for another machine to be delivered the next day (which worked fine). I appreciate some goods can be faulty and I don't blame Currys for that, but instances like this where it is obviously a faulty machine, why will Currys not take responsibility as opposed to making me fork out for an electrician to tell me what I knew all along? 2 stars for Currys, 5 stars for Jessica.",2018-10-08
1928,5bbb34bf9d37800afc6c6061,"I purchased an LG TV around 3 weeks ago, delivery all good, set up myself and no issues, product looks very good. However this TV is advertised as coming with 5 years warranty.Registering with LG they only give 1 year, ok not an issue, but trying to get proof of 5 years has proved very difficult, nothing to state 5 years on receipt etc. Went into store, they where a little confused and did not really know that much, considering how many TVs they must sell I am surprised at this, eventually someone printed me of a little slip that stated 5 years (just generic slip to not proof in its self) but this had details ot registering on website. Was advised to go online and register this item with knowhow, however they did state that this was automatic, but I did want proof of warranty Website link shows site as being offline, gives a phone number, phoned the number and was told that I had to contact LG, now I knew this was not correct, however the person would only put me through to LG, LG confirmed that they only give 1 year and the remaining was down to Currys.Not that useful, went back to Currys, saw same person as before, he phoned knowhow who stated to him that it was registered, obviously more helpful that person I spoke too, they agreed to send out warranty documentation to my home address, so I thought all ok.A few days later warranty T&Cs arrived, however no mention of warranty duration at all, just generic T&Cs statements so did not give what I had specifically asked for.After receiving this useless T&Cs document I looked online and found many similar complaints going back several years, I also found a slightly different link to that given by Currys which allowed me to enter receipt number, and this showed me that it is covered for 5 years.In conclusion I hope this is resolved but I cant say this has given me any confidance in Currys should an issue occur down the line, But the big question is why cant Currys get this right first time, I should not even have to ask or go through hoops to get this, surely it make just good sense if Currys care about customer serviceI feel it is totally unacceptable to not give proof of warranty up front with an expensive TV, what is worse is that Currys just don't seem to understand there own process or actually give a dam about rectifying it.",2018-10-08

(I had told the shop where I was and to pass this info on, they didn't). My number was on the system but nobody called to ask for directions. On the way to Currys to complain and get a refund, I popped into my local independant electrical store and brought another fridge freezer. And it was delivered IMMEDIATELY. Was told at Currys when I asked that my refund would take a day to hit my bank. Money was taken immediately when I paid therefore it should be returned without delay. Planning on buying a washing machine and tumble dryer at the end of the month. I know who I will be going to (and it isn't Currys)",2018-10-05
1946,5bb782c79d37800b6431c3aa,Shocking customer service. Placed an order to be collected the following day. Staff didn't scan the item so never received the automated email to go and collect. No one could tell me where my items were and even customer services could not get in touch with the store or the manager. I had to do all the telephoning and messaging to get to the bottom of it. One package had been opened so had to double check it all before we left the store. Not impressed. Something so simple caused a delay and wasted my time.,2018-10-05
1947,5bb776219d37800aa073515a,"Diabolical Service. I Deeply regret using them I wish I stuck with AO or anyone else for that matter. I urge anyone if it is humanly possible to avoid purchasing from them please do, just get it from somewhere else. It will only cause you stress and grief if something goes wrong.I ordered a fridge freezer and separate freezer totalling ~850GBP. I was initially really happy and excited, free delivery good deal made better with a voucher code when buying two appliances. Prior to delivery I was called by a member of the delivery team asking about the property since the fridge was large. I explained house was on the first floor essentially a set of stairs with good access all round for people to carry the item. No issues was raised, the person was very polite. On delivery day I was greeted by one of the drivers who immediately apologised and said his delivery partner doesn't want to deliver the item because it is too big. they were parked away from the house and they had hit my neighbours parked card. Driver came out and said he doesn't want to deliver because its to big and due to ""health and safety"". the gentleman mentioned he was in his 60's and was ""too old"" for it (his own words if I do recall). Interestingly he also refused to deliver the second freezer (a small under counter freezer) I felt he simply didn't want to do the work. despite myself moving house with significantly larger items and not one of the delivery drivers refused to bring items in the past. The drivers had informed me that they did not receive information that it was on the first floor. Fair enough but I know the driver and second delivery man just simply didn't want to do it. I was quite annoyed, I called the customer service line who said the delivery drivers were correct not to deliver but couldn't answer the reason why someone not capable was sent when I told them that it was a flight of open stairs outside before you got to the house. We stated we wanted to record to conversation because the service advisor refused to give his name and became very rude. We ended up hanging up. We called again this time we had a much nicer advisor who rearranged the delivery and stated he will get a team capable to deliver it. we felt much better. But this turned sour. a week later and a day before the delivery I received an emailing stating ""I have cancelled the order"" and they will process a gift card refund. To my annoyance I called and asked what is going on. The advisor stated that there was a note on the property that it was unsafe to delivery (A Lie) so Currys had cancelled the order without calling me or notifying me. If they had called I would have allowed them to deliver to the door and I would have got someone else to bring it into the house. They stated they couldn't do anything about it that the cancellation was already processed and I would have to reorder the items at a higher price without any offers (basically losing out on 150GBP). I asked to file a formal complaint very politely. But I have had no response from the complaint or acknowledgement. Its also been over a month and my refund is yet to arrive. they sent it to the wrong address somehow and now I am left with a big hole in my finances. I am also stuck with a gift card (If it ever arrives) which I am forced to purchase these items again at a significantly higher cost, from a company with the worst customer service experience I have ever had. its been a total of ~6 weeks since my initial order. I urge everyone to please stay away, they could financial ruin on you! and the amount of time spent trying to fix the issues you will cause significant stress.",2018-10-05

1949,5bb74cb39d37800b6431ab21,"Myself and my partner order a washing machine from yourselves and payed an additional cost to have this installed. On Friday the 28th September, ‘Team Know How’ set an original delivery date of Thursday 3rd of October in the afternoon. My partner stayed home the entire day (had to forfeit going to work), after waiting the entire day he decided to call ‘Team Know How’ to see what the issue was as he had not yet received any word, only then finding out it was now due to be delivered on Friday. Annoyed and upset my partner reluctantly decided he had to stay home on Friday now to wait for the delivery of the washing machine (missing yet another day of work). Around noon on Friday, my partner received a text saying the delivery date had been changed again! to the Saturday (following day). My partner has texts showing the changes in delivery days and times, and he only received them after the initial ‘missed slot’. My partner is furious that he has missed work to wait for an order that has yet to arrive and even more appalled at the customer service of ‘Team Know How’ who were, to be frank, useless at trying to resolve the situation and did nothing to reassure my partner. Yourselves as the store we purchased our washing machine from have a duty of care to make sure we are not treated like this, and that we receive our delivery as expected. We have received appalling service from ‘Team Know How’ and too some extent yourselves, for not paying closer attention to the requirement you have to your consumer, you as a company can be sure that nor myself or my partner will be returning to Curry’s again, and that will share our story with friends and family to warn them of the treatment they might receive if they chose to purchase an appliance with you.Last night my partner left a review on Trust Pilot for ‘Team Know How’ and they responded immediately to his post asking my partner to email them, which he did, he is yet to receive a response… I warn everyone who is reading this, do not use Curry’s, you will be messed around and the currier they use ‘Team Know How’ are useless.

1950,5bb7459d9d37800afc6b65eb,"The customer service is useless and horrible. I bought a Sharp washing machine in March 2018 and recently I noticed the clothes came out stained, occasionally with scum and suds. I contacted the service team and as requested I sent them the photos of the damaged clothes. I was then asked to try the different programmes, using stain remover, check the filter, etc. However, after trying all different ways, the clothes still came out dirtier than when they went into the wash, which makes me wonder it might be a fault of the machine. I contacted them again and asked for an engineer to come over and take a look, and fine to pay for the callout if it's not a fault of the machine. However, my request is refused because the manager didn't think it is a fault of the product. This is very ridiculous and I'm so cross about it. I don't know on which ground your manager could make a judgment on whether or not it's a problem of the machine itself. Or it is just an excuse for Currys to avoid responsibility? Now I'm left with a poor washing machine and don't know what to do with it except writing the review here to warn people. Life is short, don't go to Currys. They just want to sell you stuff, get the money and then walk away. It's completely a waste of money and time.",2018-10-05

Each time I visited the store asking for help I left feeling bitter and exasberated. They think that their ""Know How"" service is the answer to everything. The technicians at the other end of the phone are helpful to a degree but nothing beats having the expert actually in the room, which will never happen at Currys. (The problems remain unresolved) The delivery driver and his assistant is Currys concept of a home visit by experts(while knowing more than I do about TVs I would hesitate to call them experts or even dedicated to problem solving). After almost three weeks and a very large phone bill from elongated and futile connection to the ""Kow How"" service (Not a freephone service).I still have an underperforming brand new television which in our household has been renamed from Smart TV to Dumb TV. Thanks a bunch Currys, we're worse off now than we were with our old TV and are left with frustration and inconvenience whenever we watch television which we do less now because of it.

I immediately rang up and was told by a snotty customer service rep that inside 5 minutes my order had left the warehouse, out of sheer disbelief I rang back.. got through to a nicer rep this time who echo'd the same exact thing.. that within 5 minutes of ordering they were unable to do anything to cancel my order and that my only course of action is to wait until I get a tracking ID and .... CALL BACK. My sane mind thinking ... but I'm on the phone to you now why would I have to call back again.. you know not to generate a shipping label for this order as I've signaled my intent to cancel.So now left 300 down, awaiting a tracking ID for the privilege to ring them back to try cancel again.

I waited for the item all day as I had received no additional correspondence. I chased up with customer service the following day and have been told that there was a failure in there process and that the item was not available.

I could not get the details of this or the conversation conclusions in writing and was only given a couple of names. I asked about 20 times for the issue to be escalated to someone who could deal with the problem but this was refused and I was not allowed to speak to another member of staff or manager. I have wasted a further 1.5 hours approximately on phone calls alone trying to resolve the issue. Case number has been setup for me and I have said I want to issue a complaint but not helped to do this by customer service.Team KnowHow have so far dismissed all responsibility and are happy to be seen as untrustworthy and dishonest. I'm waiting to see if it is escalated and will update as necessary. Seems that legal action is only way to get this company to behave responsibly.I'm now getting the feeling that Currys PC World have an automated or copy and paste procedure for dealing with negative feedback.

Anyway stated we would like a particular fridge checked stock and out of stock, selected another and same story. He did not know when the next delivery was, but after being delivered to the store it could then be another 10 to 14 days for delivery. He pointed out that most of the display stock was all out of stock. Went to Argos in the end and got it delivered within 5 days, same make and model as Currys.

The store advised they can not process a refund but can arrange a collection from the store which will take 20 minutes to book in or advised me go away and to do it myself to my astonishment I said I would rather they do it as it is such an expensive item. All booked in they provided a DPD tracking number which would give me updates on the return. Two days later the parcel was still sitting in the store so I went into the store again and they had no clue as to why it had not been collected and they told me many parcels were awaiting collection.

1988,5bad21828c83fd06e0c5423e,"Never Ever Shop At Currys PC World!I write this review in complete distress and frustration regarding my experience with Currys PC World. Since purchasing my Sony tv, I am unhappy to say that I am far from pleased with the service I am receiving. I believe that during this awful and upsetting period, my customer rights have been neglected. In addition to this, I will not purchase any other products from Sony or Currys PC World in the foreseeable future. I believe the issues I am currently dealing with are all against the promises within my contract and therefore they have been breaking their agreement with me.My Sony tv has been faulty for more than 9 months, with Currys PC World having acknowledge that. Bearing in mind, nothing has been done since. The most annoying part of this difficult period is to this day they are still charging me for the care plan policy. This completely prevented my family from using the poor performing product. The way we have been dealt with has made us suffer in a way like no other. Moreover, the service I am receiving is rarely anywhere near the advertised promise that Currys PC World used to entrap me. I am never ever purchasing anything from Currys PC World or Sony.As well as this, I even have tried to get in touch with the company via emails and letters. As months had passed; I did not hear anything back from the company. This proves to show that they never cared about me henceforth making me feel more upset and frustrated than ever. Also, to get these letters to the company I paid for 1st class stamps just so that I can get at least 1 reply from the firm to say, ‘everything is going to be alright’. However, after not hearing anything from the company as time went on, I rang up several times; only to look like a fool each time. The long awaiting queues and being transferred from department to department I wasn’t having it. Therefore, I went into store, but the disrespectful staff clearly weren’t there to help but instead they all turned out to be ‘money grabbing’ thieves who just act to care when helping you to purchase a product but when things go south, you’re on your own to suffer. I hope people look at this review and decide to go shop at a better business as in AO.com, Argos, John Lewis etc. As of recent, I quiet recently received a reply from the company claiming to have discovered I took part in foul play. In no way, shape or firm would I ever disrespect or purposely damage a property of my own. But as someone who works more than 37 hours a week and barely earns a minimum wage I try my best to provide for me and my family. But it just goes to show that there are people out there to make you’re a life a living hell. The product became damaged as I was adjusting the wall bracket. So, as I was doing this my young boy was also playing in the same room. Furthermore, he came up to the tv and accidentally nudged it as he was trying to reach for his toy causing the tv to fall in the process. The tv then fell onto a toy causing the damage to look much worse than it already was. Now, things just can’t get any worse. Through all this, Currys PC World have seemed to get the whole situation muddled up, for one they misspelt my second name and second of all the serial number of my tv is completely different to the one they have placed in their reply letter. This just proves to show that they haven’t paid much attention to my situation. Once again, Currys PC World do not care at all about me as a customer.Even though I have been complaining on various occasions, I have every right to do so. I strongly believe I should be fully compensated for the money I have paid for the product as well as receive an upgrade from the tv I have purchased. I would never ever recommend anyone from purchasing a product from Currys PC World again.",2018-09-27

1991,5bacba9c8c83fd06e0c512d8,"I am so furious right now! I am absolutely disgusted with Curry's customer service! I brought a tumble dryer from them in November 2016. It was a Grundig Heat pump dryer and we picked this model due to the 5-year warranty it came with, which as it didn’t even last 2 years is somewhat concerning. The dryer started to make a screeching noise when turning, so I called Grundig. This was on the 28th August. The earliest date available for repair was Monday 10th September. Although the customer services agent did say that someone would call, as they could most likely fit me in before this. This of course didn’t happen. The engineer was vey helpful but after inspecting the dryer said it was beyond repair and I would need a replacement. Someone from Grundig called the next morning and provided me with an exchange number for Curry's. When I called them, the agent I spoke to, took the details and put the order through. I was advised I would receive a call back within 72 hours to confirm my delivery date. Nobody called back, so I called Curry's on 14th October. After waiting 20 minutes for my call to answered, I was advised by the agent that due to me buying my original dryer so long ago, my invoice had been archived but the order had now gone through and I would receive a call back by Monday at the latest. This once again didn’t happen. I called Curry's again on Tuesday 18th October, as I hadn’t heard anything back. After waiting again for over 20 minutes for my call to answered, when I spoke to the agent, she advised that the item was out of stock, the order had never gone through and the next delivery into the warehouse wasn’t until Sunday 23rd, at which time, 30 of the dryers were coming in. After going through the whole, long saga with her, I requested a delivery date to be booked in, in advance. I was advised that this was not possible, until the stock was actually in the warehouse. When I expressed my frustration, I was offered 10% compensation as a gesture of goodwill, that I could sort out, once my delivery was arranged. She advised someone would call me back on Monday 24th October. This, surprisingly, didn’t happen! I called Curry's again on Tuesday 25th October, once again waiting for my call to be answered for nearly 20 minutes. The agent advised the dryers weren’t due to come in on Sunday 23rd, were due in on the 25th, so they had arrived that day! She then advised me 7 of them had been delivered, with another 23 arriving on 11th October! She said the order had been put through and I should get a call back within 24 hours. When I asked her to confirm that I would definitely receive 1 of the 7 dryers in stock, she advised hopefully, as only 3 had been ordered! I then advised her that I wouldn’t be waiting until 11th October. As you can guess, I didn’t receive a call back, so I once again called Curry's on Wednesday 26th October. The agent I spoke to advised me the dryers were now in stock but as they weren’t when the order was placed, the order had never gone through! Despite being told it had, every time I called! He then manually put the order through and advised I would get an email confirming the delivery date within 24 hours! Guess what, it never happened, surprise, surprise!!! I have now called them this morning, 27th September. I once again waited for 20 minutes to get through. The agent I spoke to said the order hadn’t been processed yet and he would chase it up and call me back!! I advised him that I would hold until he had sorted it out and that I wanted to speak to a supervisor. After having to fight my ground, to get this matter dealt with, as no supervisors were available, he put me on hold to find one. After 20 minutes of waiting, he then advised be there were no supervisors that I could talk to. He also advised the order was still sitting in the queue and he hadn’t been able to get through to sort it out. I said I would wait until it was and hopefully a supervisor would be available. After an hour on the phone, I have now got a delivery date of Saturday 29th September for the dryer to arrive (almost 5 weeks!! Since it first broke down!!). The agent then told me that the 10% compensation, although noted, hadn’t been sent to the right department, but that he would send it to finance, who will call me back within 4 days, which as we know is highly unlikely. He also advised he would pass this on to a manager and hopefully someone would be in touch, but once again from the way he said it and past experience, I have more chance of winning the lottery this evening, than of speaking to a manger at Curry's. This entire experience, the level of customer service, the time and money I have lost when I am at work and the general lack of caring about their customers, the apparent lack of training staff receive, as they can’t seem to send things to the correct department or notice something isn’t in stock, shown by Curry's and its management team, is absolutely atrocious and I would advise anyone to think twice before buying anything from them. This has been one of the most frustrating and infuriating experiences I have had and if we treated our customers in this way, we wouldn’t be in business anymore!!",2018-09-27

I ordered an item for installation and the installers came and were fine, however they were unable to complete the job due to an issue my end and advised me to re-book.I fixed the issue my end and called to re-book and was told that they could do a choice of a few days however as I work full time I told them I could only do weekends. I was advised their delivery calendar can only view 2 weeks at a time and as Saturdays were booked up ,I had to call the following Monday to try and book a Saturday appointment but with no assurances I could get a Saturday installation.I asked if they could pencil me in for the following Saturday and when the appointment became available book me in and call me back to confirm, however they do not offer this option.As such they promised their 'routing' team would call me back in a 'few hours' to see what they could do but they did not call me back.As I am between houses and this order was delaying my house move, I had no choice but to cancel the order and was on hold for 20 minutes to get through to the refund team (tells you all you need to know really) .It's kind of sad as the installers and cancellation team were lovely but the customer service team were unwilling to 'go the extra mile' or 'think outside the box' to help a customer. The customer service team were also very stand offish and abrupt.Also for a massive company to only offer a 2 week delivery window, that's not fair when that takes up half of your 28 day return policy does it?My suggestions would be:-Expand your booking windowEmpathise with your customers------UPDATE------Despite cancelling my order, I since received multiple calls with people requesting to install my order, I did want to speak to them to as to why i was being called when I requested a refund. Unfortunately I could not as I was at work. I requested a call back, as it was from an unknown number I could not call them back but the call never came.I requested my initial refund on the day I posted the review and was told 3-5 days maximum and I am still waiting! I am aware this may involve 'working days' so the 5th working day may be tomorrow, however if it is not in my account tomorrow I will be calling them back:'(------UPDATE PART 2------I have now received confirmation from Currys & Team Knowhow that my refund has NOT been approved as they have not received my item!This is despite the fact that the installation team (Team Knowhow) had taken back the item and I am no longer in possession of the item and I was verbally promised that my refund has been approved.I am now seeking legal action.",2018-09-28

When I got to the store I found that there were other optical cables on the shelf starting at £9.99, I spoke to the manager and explained the situation, I have been given a remote for a different model of LG sound bar and as such doesn't work as it should, I ordered and paid for a new replacement in store which has been refunded to me, on the optical cable front I have been given the one that should have come with the sound bar in the first place and been refunded for the one I should never have been sold, the manager tried to make me believe that he was doing me a favour as my model wouldn't normally come with a cable, which is a lie. I am completely applauded at the lack of customer care and total lack of competence of staff. When I asked the manager what he was going to do about compensating me for my time and being miss-sold a product by one of his staff he said 'there's nothing I can do'. Please advise me on what Currys intends to do to rectify this situation.This was my first email. I received an email 6 days later to essentially tell me they haven’t read it or intend on to. The service is awful at best and criminal at worst. I will never spend a single penny there again.

I wanted the HP stream 11 laptop but the only laptop on stock was the one on display and then he told me its not the right choice for me. I told them I want a small laptop easy to carry and that I can use microsoft word on but i told him i wanted to buy it off display and then he told us it's going to take 2 hrs to restore we told him we don't have time to wait that long. After looking at several other laptops, all apparently not good enough for my purpose, eventually we decided on another laptop which was in stock. The staff member who originally served us passed us on to another staff member who then proceeded to tell us the laptop we chose was not good enough for us. What I don't understand is that I'm buying this laptop for my own personal who are they to say it's not good enough for me. I told the new staff member I don't care what he thinks I want this one and eventually was able to buy it. Overall the experience was so bad, I would never go back to this branch again.

New information will be found on the last couple of pages.1) 3 Samsung TVs, 3 Blue Ray players and a Sound Bar £4738.00 rrp in delivered, and some returned, in one week. 2) 2 financing contracts completed in one week.3) The goods we owned, on one occasion, delivered with no care for the items or the health and safety of the delivery guys.4) Delivery guys with no apparent knowledge, or competence, to install, tune and demonstrate the equipment were used delivering in an unmarked van.5) One TV was repacked with the legs scrapping against the screen and left open.6) Rooms were left with packing materials strewn all over place.7) Five return journeys to the store amounted to some six miles each time let alone the time and nuisance value experienced.8) At least one Sound Bar was not working even when an expert tried to make it work.9) An expert had to be contracted in, by the store, at their cost, to deliver a working system. He visited three times.10) Large amounts of emotional stress, strain and disappointment at the failure in the provision of the equipment we had selected especially as it was a birthday gift.11) Incompetence, lack of continuity and fulfilment of the reasonable wishes of the customer from the Call Centre and with some staff at the store. 12) There was even one Know-How colleague who couldn’t even open a Word Document!Response from CurrysDear Phil,Case reference: CC3758667Thank you for your email following your recent Trustpilot review. I am very sorry to hear of all the issues you've had with ourselves, it is disappointing to hear and not up to the standards we do strive to offer. I have added the details of your email to your existing complaints case, the reference for which is noted at the top of the email.From the complaints case I have noted that you have already been in discussion with us regarding this matter. Regrettably, I am unable to increase the £100.00 offer given previously. However, should you wish to accept this at this stage then let me know and I'll be happy to get this processed.Kind regards,Ryan",2018-09-27

Sent an engineer out a week later, they needed a part, they came again a week later, replaced all circuit boards, still doesn't work. Engineer said they would have to go away and find out what the problem was.So we're now 4 weeks without a dishwasher that we paid £700 for. No contact back from the engineer, and no follow up from Grundig or PC world.When calling the engineer, there is no facility to leave a voicemail, and they are very poor at answering the phone.As a new Currys PC World and Grundig customer we are left completely in the dark, I would suggest staying clear of this brand. They simply do not care, and are more than happy it seems to leave us with a dishwasher that is not fit for purpose.",2018-09-25

I have had items come back from repair that have then begun to fall to bits, laptops that have gone away for things such as a replacement screen or keyboard only to return with a new hard drive, something that wasn't requested and thereby resulting in a fight to get the old hard drive, along with all of the data on it, returned, something they are not happy to do but will eventually capitulate to when threatened with legal action, it is data theft after all.",2018-09-25

We had some plumbling issues, when the plumber pulled the dishwasher out, the leg got broken. This is not even a hard pull, and that was the quality of the product. This is the beginning.When we contacted Kenwood, they said Currys are solely responsible for that model as they are the ones who manufacture it. Contacted them and to my surprise they said they donot have the spares and no plans when the parts will be available. This part is not available any where on the internet, and its not suited with any other Kenwood models.We explained about what happened and the agents said, as it was not broken by them they cant do anything about the parts. I said we are happy to pay for the part . even for that they were not helpful. I have been purchasing with them for a long time now and this would be my last. Same is the case with my friends and family...So avoid them by any cost. According to them, if they dont break it its not their problem.. and they wont help it to solve the problem.",2018-09-25

She also insisted that we couldn't have fibre where we live despite the fact that I had checked online beforehand and the web site said it was available. She the also told us that you can't have multi room with Talk Talk again somthing else I had checked online and was available. She also said we would not be able to keep our current phone number I think if Currys are going to offer this service in store they should at least have trained staff that know the available products.I ended up sorting it out for myself and kept our phone number got fibre and multi room,2018-09-24

I have spent overall 376 minutes(!!) on the phone being put through to different departments and staff that is rude, entitled and racist. The TV that arrived was broken - you could hear it through the box, yet they said to me over the phone that I 'could be lying about this'. The CEO repeated this through his secretaries. I have actually stupidly ordered another set from them, despite this they are refusing a refund as apparently I lie about the breakage. What pirate company is this?

Bald manager kept whizzing around looking ""busy"" but without doing any obvious task in hand, emphasised by how empty the store was.

They were supposed to call back and update, but they DIDN'T! so after we callked, they said they will send a new item and replace it with the older one. BUT THEY DIDN'T again!! this time we called again, they said ohh we do not have this item in stuck, choose another in the same range. But then they do not have anything close to the offer price we had. Still having a faulty fridge - still no replacement and still no refund or anything further.

I range the customer service and the man was very dismissive and said there was nothing he would do. I cannot believe I have a broken rib, a cracked cooker.

Was advised they could rebook for the following Saturday and if not happy I could ask for a refund. Thought I might have better luck with their customer service in branch so went in to see them. Manager was off and the gentleman filling in for him was not at all sympathetic. Reiterated they could rebook for the following week or give us a refund. All the time chewing gum in front of us. I have been a loyal customer of currys buying washing machines, dishwashers, TVs and computers but will not buy anythsing else there again and if you are looking for a decent level of customer service would advise you look elsewhere. The branch in question was Bishopbriggs.Quick update re their continued incompetence. Today (Sun) just received a text from team knowhow saying they were going to delivery the item this Tues. Good luck with that we have told them time and again we cannot take deliveries through the week.

2038,5ba54a548c83fd0b58dad6dd,My TV recently broke but that wasn’t a problem as I had insurance that I had paid for 9 years totalling £485. With the original price of the television being £425 so £910 paid in total. I followed the instructions asked to bring the television into store and for them to send it off to be repaired and if not be given a replacement. I was informed that my television was beyond repair and to take a code into store and they would be giving you a voucher to purchase a new TV. I went to the customer service desk to be told that my voucher covered a television worth £249. A lessser brand than the TV owned previous and white surrounding. When I queried why it was 249 and not the price I paid for my original device I was told this was a far superior model and should be happy to take it. However this arrogant response from a very dismissive member of staff is not acceptable. In 9 years you would hope any brand was advanced further on but insurance should provide a model that is of the same value. So I decided to look at TV’s at a higher spec and thought I suppose I will just swallow this pill and pay the difference and then decided on a TV but was told it was out of stock and they would deliver it to me at a cost of £30. At this point I decided to challenge why the offer was so low? They said look if you don’t like what we’ve got for you then it’s not our problem go home and ring the insurance. I went home and rang the insurance only to be told I had to go back to the store and they were to ring the insurance from the store. I went back to the store to explain this and they were like oh yes I wasn’t sure but that’s what we do usually. After a few tuts and making me feel more and more unwelcome they decided to ring the insurance. The store rang them and spoke to the insurance but gave me not opportunity to speak my case. And this point not only being upset and feeling a sense of injustice I began to feel confused to why I had wasted my time and petrol driving home. Eventually the manager spoke to me and again was rude and a reflection of his staff. After over 1 hour 30 mins I left the store thinking I didn’t want to ever return. I find it disgusting how not only you think it’s acceptable to sell insurance plans that don’t cover anything but have colleagues who have don’t have a care in the world and make you feel in the wrong and like it’s your fault. I will make sure I never spend another penny in currys and anybody who I have the chance to tell I will. A customer is for life you’ve lost not just one but 100’s with your cheap skate scheme.,2018-09-21
2039,5ba5453c8c83fd0b58dad530,Well where do we start Currys I'm sorry but the disrespect you have for your customers is bang out of order. I bought an American style fridge freezer on the 7/7/18 and the ice machine was broken when it turned up. You sent an engineer out great well done. He replaced the pcb board. But the cowboy you sent out cross wired the board and didn't connect the multi pin light and door sensors connectors on to the board. Then the engineer put a lighting unit on order but all he had to do was plug the connector block in properly. The 10/8/18 the lighting unit turned up. And wasted my time installing a unit that was working at that time. 3/9/18 less than 60 days old. The water valve stopped working on the open positions and woke up to a flooded kitchen. I rang knowhow once again who Informed me it's a kenwood issue ring them . So I rang kenwood ( who is now owned by dixion group) who said I couldn't do anything I have to give them 4 faults before they will write the unit off. Even tho I had to install a new floor. Rang know how again who said nout to do with us. Went in to store 5/9/18 who couldn't do anything so I had a damaged kitchen and not fit for purpose fridge. Finally got curry to see common sense and give me a write off number after 10 phone calls and 3 visits to the shops 14/9/18 spoke to know how again who wrote the unit off and told me to change the unit on Sunday .16/9/18. Attended currys again to exchange the unit picked a new fridge went to put it through and low and behold the computer fail and rejects the return spoke to the G.S.M who attempted to do it computer error I was there 6 hours.17/9/18 went back to store again no change (SALT error) range know how. Who told me that's there was nothing wrong and the store could exchange it. 18/9/18 returned to store again same error. Was told I would be contacted on the 20/9/18 by the store G.S.M no communication. 21/9/18 Attended the store who said that due to the computer issue there was no way to process the unit due to computer error. The only way we can do it is if you bring back the item to store. ( it's a 145kg 6foot by 4 foot fridge). Iv had to hire a van to move this heavy paper wait out my house only 18 days after the incident.in short save your money go to AO.com,2018-09-21

Rang next day and was given a priority morning slot, 3 days later (so annoying) stayed in all morning and no delivery. Rang again and was told it was next on the list. However after talking to the driver, the van was too big to get to our property and he had gone over his driving time!!! We ended up going to meet him just off motorway and pick up the tv ourselves ( it was that or send it out another day in a small van). Terrible service and communication from the minute we paid, as is the case these days, once they have your money they are really not bothered. Gesture of goodwill for all the time wasting etc. £30.00, this is the value they put on letting their customers down 3 times, not a lot for a big company to change their ways... won’t be using them again!!!!",2018-09-21

Ok fair enough but doesn't explain how I was sent a used item. 2) blu Ray player - also opened and re taped to make it look unused yet the seal was clearly cut, also they didn't deliver it on time as promised by customer services. 3) dryer that was purchased and within 2months was leaking and had to call out hotpoint engineer to fix it. Baring in mind with the hot summer we had it was barely used. 4) cooker hob sent and the ceramic hot plates were all rusty, clearly been stored incorrectly or had a leak of water near the item but sold anyway. 5) another dryer was fitted this weekend and once taken out of the packaging a large dent to the side of it.It's fair enough that a customer has one issue but to consistently have issues time and time again is not acceptable....",2018-09-21
2044,5ba403c58c83fd09c46adf06,"i ordered a lens online. I was told that the item would be available from the Plymouth Marsh Mills shop the following day. Yesterday evening I went to the store at 1600 hrs. I reported to the collection point which was unattended. At the front of the store was a manager with a mobile phone who seemed to be directing operations. After five minutes I still had not been served. After several more minutes of staring at the manager, he made gestures that he was calling someone to attend to me. After several more minutes a member of staff turned up at the collection point. With no apology for keeping me waiting she took my details and went to get my item. After another five minutes she walked passed me and started looking around the camera section. After another five minutes she reported to the manager with the phone who appeared to call another member of staff .Another member of staff appeared and both staff embers spent another ten minutes looking for my item. One of the team members then took the display model lens to the manager who directed her to the collection point to look again. My wife went over to the manager and asked him what was going on. He told her that there was a problem with the stock and they were now checking the receipt bay again. After another five minutes the manager came over and told us that he was sorry but the item was not in the store. He did not offer to see if it was available anywhere else or suggest anything that would help me obtain my ordered item. When I placed my order I supplied a mobile phone number so that the company could contact me in the event of any problems with my order. When I asked him why nobody had phoned me, he said that they were short of staff an were very busy. I had a very glib apology from the manager and I left the store 45minutes after entering the store very annoyed at the attitude and performance of the manager and his staff. I still have not got my lens ad have not been given any indication of how I can obtain it from Currys PC World. At the collection point were four other customers who had experienced the same poor service from the Plymouth store. This store is a total joke. I would like someone from Currys PC World to contact me about the poor service encountered by me.",2018-09-20
2045,5ba3d2a98c83fd06e0c29c0b,"If you're wanting even a little bit of decent customer service I would avoid at all costs. When I went to one of the branches in Gateshead - Metro centre I was looking for a particular laptop but the advisor actually showed me two alternatives which were smaller (and more expensive). I said I'd take a few days to think and come back. I returned a few days later to find the price had gone up, and there was nothing them or even their customer services could do about it. The fact the sales advisor hadn't advised the price is subject to change as he knew I was coming back was extremely frustrating and I didn't even know the laptop I chose in the end was on sale as it didn't say! The customer advisor was actually lovely though and the only person from this whole experience who seemed to know what he was doing which is a shame as he just missed out that information. When I rang up the customer service the man was so unhelpful and his attitude was rude. I was then transferred over to the manager, who was sympathetic but still couldn't help. The frustrating part was that I wasn't told the price may alter and I was going to pay £200 MORE for the better laptop from their recommendations. Not one member of staff cared even though I was going to take my business elsewhere, I mean surely having a customer spend hundreds on a laptop and saving £50 is better than taking their custom elsewhere? Any other brand would have honoured it. The manager of that particular branch rang me but he was trying to convince me to go to a worse laptop and throw in software which cost £10 and was trying to say customers would feel pressurised to buy but I said it doesn't, it helps make the decision. I couldn't find the particular laptop anywhere else which was irritating so I decided to go to a different branch down the country thinking it'll have better customer service and I'll just pay the higher price (even though I did not want to do this but being in desperate need, I knew I had to). However when I came to pay the advisor was pretty much whispering and there was an issue with one of the offers and the sales advisor was trying to tell me that it wasn't going to work however the other sales advisor I seen in the previous branch said it would and I could do it online. He then got a manager who sorted it out. I got no apology and it was extremely poor. I would stay away from them at all unless you want poor customer service. Hopefully a new business will become their competitor and they'll actually think of how they're conducting business.",2018-09-20
2046,5ba3c86b8c83fd0b58da5344,"Returned a set of Sony £330 headphones in swindon branch where I bought them when the headband had snapped. They were 17 months old and hardly used (maybe 25hrs in total) and always handled carefully. This was a well known manufacturing defect with them all over the internet (19% of Amazon reviews were 1 star all for headband snapping). Returned them under EU 2 year guarantee as not fit for purpose with a manufacturing defect and customer service desk lady (gemma) said she couldnt deal in store and told to go away with a telephone number to ring. HELLO it says customer service in big letters above you and on your badge -despite her insisting she couldnt help me I refused to be fobbed off. Got her to ring customer services in store for me where they started to deal with it (see she could deal with it in store after all!) The best thet could offer me was £195 voucher- really! for selling me £330 top of the range headphones that were always destined to break! I was losing my patience so just opted to take the money. Got a replacement pair and paid another £135 to make up the £330 for a replacemt pair (grrrr). Low and behold they had a electrical fault right out the box! So back to currys I went. They didnt have a replacement black pair the same as what I had and offered me the silver pair. No thank you -I like black. They didnt have any online or in any localish stores but had a pair in bristol airport store (not really that far from swindon). Fine I’ll have them. Get them to swindon and I’ll pick them up. No we dont do that. Fine get them to post to my house. No they wont do that either. What! Ok refund me, I’ll ring the store myself and I’lll get them to post to my home- I’ll even pay the postage myself! No sorry cant do that! Ok just refund my voucher for cash refund and I’ll get a pair elsewhere. No cant do that either!!So now I have to what weeks/ maybe months for Swindon to get a pair in despite there being a pair in the company anyway doing nothing!! All the while the customer service ladies were abrupt and unhelpful and irritared I was even there - despit it being me who should have been the irritated one!

It was on sale as it was the last one, so the display model. Staff were friendly enough until the dreaded extras sale, insurance cover, set up service, know how cloud storage!!!!! I refused all of these products. So when I went to the till I was told I couldnt take the lap top as it had to be reset, I would have to pick it up next day. Ok . So then again the sales pitch with the set up service, but I could have £20 off and free cloud storage. Again I refused . Google offer a perfectly acceptable storage FREE and The so called set up service @ £50 as far as I can tell is backing up the computer system which any one can do themselves from the system settings for free. Only realising after I left the shop that they had charged me £20 for cloud storage. What a shambles and to top it off I got a phone call about an hour later to say the laptop was ready.So I have now had the £20 refunded and picked up the laptop. Only it hasn't been reset. I have had to do it myself. Further more they haven't even wiped the laptop over. It's still covered in dust and finger marks where it was on display.

The delivery driver removed all packaging on the lorry and brought the appliance in to my house, being very careful not to allow me to see the damage on the side of the oven. Had I seen this I would have refused delivery! Installed and shown that all hobs and ovens lit up. Came to use it that evening and the door would not open as it hit the floor. The installation was not complete as the installer did not level the appliance properly as in too much of a rush to leave. Emailed the same evening and received an email over one week later:Thank you for contacting Team KNOWHOW. We are really sorry that we haven't contacted you within our timescales we really do hope that your query has been answered. It may be that you have visited one of our stores or called us to discuss your query. However, if you feel the matter remains unresolved, please contact us on 0344 800 9090 or alternatively please respond including a contact number for us to call you at a convenient time and one of our colleagues will be happy to assist. Thank you for your patience and once again please accept our apologies.Kind regards,Team Knowhow::DISCLAIMER:: Clearly communication is not a strong point. My reply:Good evening, Sadly I have not been able to go to a store. My query has not been answered and I have been without the use of an oven now for days. I have not called as I thought that the email I sent [attached again for reference] was sufficient and am surprised that it has taken so long for a reply to be received. I am appalled at the customer service provided and very much need assistance with provision of a safe, working oven which I thought I ordered. Not being able to cook our own meals is very inconvenient and expensive, to say the least. A late apology is clearly not enough as obviously I require a replacement oven. I am surprised that I have to be asked if I have been in to store or phoned – clearly communication is an issue at Currys. My number is *****************. I believe I provided this when ordering and am surprised that I am required to provide this again. Regards,Next reply:Dear ****,Case Reference: CC3788086Thank you for your email dated 12th September 2018. Please accept my apologies for the delay in this response. I would have liked to discuss this further over the telephone, however, there was no response on the number provided. My response therefore is via email.I was concerned to learn that your product was delivered damaged. If the damage is not affecting the functioning of the product and you are willing to keep the product, we can offer you a 10% refund of the purchase price.Alternatively, if you would like to book an exchange, please contact us on 0344 561 1234 as soon as possible to arrange this. We would ask that you have your serial number to hand when calling.Thank you for taking the time to contact to us. I hope that these actions will bring a satisfactory conclusion to this matter.Kind regards,Junaid MahmoodTeam KnowhowI replied:Junaid, Thank you for your email. You state that you would have liked to have discussed this over the phone however I only had one missed call that day. Clearly you did not retry my number and so I can only assume you didn’t want to discuss this. I will call this week and want to speak to a manager. I have been without a functioning oven for too long and have now only been offered 10% discount if I keep a damaged product? This customer service is appalling – I should not have to be chasing for this problem to be rectified. I feel that the item should be exchanged and a discount provided for the inconvenience!

I wonder why?Managed to get through to Samantha who offered a refund or an exchange, only that to exchange the item, I needed to wait another 2 weeks for stock to arrive or get another oven [same price or cheaper] delivered - and none of which met the specification were in stock! Not allowed to pay extra to get a better model over the phone - even despite the huge delay, poor communication. I asked to speak to a manager and was only offered a call back later in the day once Samantha had spoken to her manager. I was told I would be called back by a certain time. Only 30 minutes remaining until this time has elapsed. I hope Samantha has a better answer than before. If she calls at all......",2018-09-19

2056,5ba148128c83fd0974a2bc98,Avoid at all cost!I ordered an oven with end of line discount for an elderly couple. Took a day of work to limit their stress when it was delivered and installed. The old oven was removed and decommissioned. On installation the new oven was found to be faulty and therefore removed. As the old oven was decommissioned it could not be refitted but I was promised a new one the next day. Nothing happened the next day. Customer services told me that the only way to get an early delivery was to cancel the old order and make a new order for a different oven which did not have a discount. This would ensure next day delivery. Once the transaction was made the delivery date was delayed for three days. I now have an elderly couple with no way of getting a hot meal. I have had a working oven removed which they refused to give back. I have paid for two ovens and wasted hours on the phone trying sort something out.

Got it home and it had a password on it baring in mind it was 8pm also so the store had shut had to wait until the next morning. Had to leave it there for an hour to be resolved. 6 days later our fridge freezer packed in!! All food was defrosted and destroyed. Rang curries who For 2 hours past us from number to number to be told they wouldnt reimburse the fridge food as it can be consumed that day and would give us £50 for loss of freezer food (we didn't keep food shop receipts) I'm sorry but whoever can eat 500g of butter and a jar of mustard and lives to tell the tale come shake my hand! Everything has been binned and we have to wait until tomorrow for a delivery of a new one. When we first got the fridge one of the drawers was broken! This to me looks like it's been thrown about. So we had to take it to store and swap for the display one. We will never shop at curries again and hope people read this and go elsewhere. They have no skills of customer care! We are appauled at their lack of care. All in all 4 hours later were with no fridge and they can't transfer money for 3 days.. please save yourselves and go elsewhere.

2071,5b9ea8e28c83fd06e0c0e82f,"Myself & my wife bought a complete Samsung package from Curry’s/PC World in November 2017. The package consisted of a 65” QLED TV, Sound Bar, DVD & One Box which costing over £4000.00. Since the date of installation, which was February 2018 we have had nothing but problems with the products. We have had to contact the Knowhow team at Curry’s/PC World & Samsung support on numerous occasions. We have been passed from pillow to post with each party blaming one another. The problem we have encountered has been interference to the sound quality either from the TV, Sound Bar or One Box. After numerous contact with the above agencies finally at the beginning of this month (September 2018) somebody from the Knowhow team at Curry’s/PC World spent in excess of 3 hours on the phone to my wife going through every diagnostic test they could think of & finally conceded they were baffled by the problem. The time spent doing this caused my wife undue distress as she is partially sited & found the whole process difficult to cope with, never mind the time it took up. On a previous occasion with Samsung support, they informed us that we would have to get the “faulty” equipment to Kettering, which is 25 miles from our property, which we felt was wholly unacceptable. Finally the Knowhow team arranged for the TV & One Box to be collected from our property on the Saturday 8th September 2018 with a possible return date on the Saturday 15th September. When the collection team turned up they were under the impression they had come to deliver an item (although they did not know what?) and were reluctant to take the items as in their words they had no packaging to transport our items in. One of the collection men even stated “we can take it if you want us to but the One Box will probably just get lost”. This obviously did leave us feeling very confident even though we called the Knowhow team just to clear up the confusion. However a text message was received the following day to confirm that the items had been received safely. On Wednesday 13th September we received a voicemail stating that the One Box would be collected the following day Thursday 14th September, this then prompted more phonecalls to the Knowhow team trying to explain the whole situation again, reiterating the fact that the One Box had been sent with the TV on the 8th September. We were promised that somebody would call the following day to inform us that either the One Box had been located or arrangements would be made for the One Box to be replaced and delivered back with the TV, that phonecall did not happen. Once again we had to initiate communication with the Knowhow team to assertain the current state of play with our items. We then received a text message on Friday 14th September to say that they were still working hard to repair our items & would let us know a new return date once the repair had been completed. Just over an hour later we received another text, stating that the Home Service team would be with us the following day between 15:00-19:00. This visit by the Home Service team we found out was to collect the One Box!!!. This then prompted another phonetical to the Knowhow team, where again we had to go over all the above events for the umpteenth time. This call resulted in the person from the Knowhow team stating that this whole situation should have been escalated to their investigations team as there were obviously confusion as to where items actually were & what was happening to them. Even after this call the Home Service team still turned up to collect the One Box which had been taken the previous week. So here we are 8 days from when our equipment was collected and we have no idea when, or if we will ever see our items again. Curry’s/PC World & their Knowhow team should throughly ashamed of the service they provide.",2018-09-17

2075,5b9ce8738c83fd0b58d84761,"I am writing to raise a serious complaint against the negligence of your installation engineers which caused damage to our goods and property.We ordered a fridge and washing machine from Currys Hemel store on 26.08.2018.Fridge was delivered couple of days later.Washing Machine at that time was not in stock and we were advised it would be available on 08.09.2018. Which was fine by us. We also booked laundry install for washing machine for extra £25 along with the product support for both the items on top of our cost for the products.We got text from currys that the washing machine can be delivered and installed on 8.09.2018. At the due time the machine was installed and also tested by the delivery person to check it was working fine.After the machine being installed we noticed leak from our under sink pipe. Please note the sink and machine are next to each other.Also bear in mind we have just moved in to a new build property. So everything including all the plumbing is brand new. So there is NO way that there was problem with the pipes from before. Also there was no leak whatsoever before the machine was installed. Straight after the washing machine was installed, when we used our kitchen sink the water started to constantly flow from under sink pipe. We discovered that while the washing machine was installed by the Currys delivery guy, he knocked off one of the under sink pipe which caused breakage to the pipe and leak which also damaged the under sink shelf from constant drip from pipe. Along with the stress of moving and shifting to the new house, this breakage has caused extra stress for no fault of ours.We paid extra £25 for installation of the washing machine thinking currys installation team will be experienced and professional. We had no idea that it will damage our own personal goods causing us extra cost to get it fixed.I would like to make a formal complaint against the experience we had in terms of stress we have faced causing damage to our brand new property and also having to pay for the cost of getting the pipe repaired.Please get in touch ASAP to advise how it would be rectified.I would like to also add that I have been your regular customer for years for most of my electrical appliances and goods and never had such awful and unacceptable experience. I might not be shopping with you ever again if I don't get satisfactory resolution to my complaint. Also I will be forwarding my complaint to all the social channels available to get a satisfactory resolution.",2018-09-15

After powering on, none of the compartments got cold.Called the only number they give you for Team Knowhow, 'leave it for 24 hrs'. Still not getting cold.Visited the Norwich store (Sunday), they tried to contact BEKO but gave up after 20 mins because we couldn't locate the serial number (!). Norwich store staff agreed to give me a refund but only AFTER they had collected the faulty BEKO. 'Uplift' only on Monday & Fridays.So waited the TWO weeks for Currys to collect between 2 - 6pm yesterday. No one came. Called Team Kh for 42 mins. '... the van was too big for our drive ...'

2080,5b9c13a28c83fd0b58d820f5,I purchased a Samsung Washing machine on Sunday 08/09 and delivery was arranged for Friday 14/09. Delivery arrived as scheduled but the machine was damaged. The delivery driver said he would take it back and call me with arrangements for delivering a replacement. No phone call was received so I rang the customer service line and my call was eventually answered after nearly 25 mins. I was put on hold twice only to be told the machine was no longer in stock and that I would have to return to the store I purchased it from to obtain a refund or select an alternative. I went to the store and waited 30mins for my refund to be processed. Pathetic customer service and no real attempt made to find a solution. I have since found the same machine at a lower price with immediate availability. I will never shop with Currys PC world again and advise you all to look elsewhere!,2018-09-14
2081,5b9bf40c8c83fd06e0c05661,"I've taken delivery of a washing machine and to say I am appalled at the lack of customer service from both the delivery team and the call centre is an understatement. The delivery vehicle was emblazoned with 'Team Know How' - think an urgent re-branding is due!BEWARE Currys promote an installation/recycle option at point of sale but its a massive con, they have no intention of fulfilling this commitment and are quite happy to leave their customer's stranded. This is a real weakness for a multi national and shame on them for not having a process to respond to complaints.In a nutshell I did not have the promised warning message 30 mins ahead of delivery (3.45pm) but this wasn't a problem despite waiting in all day other than I hadn't turned the water off and laid down protective sheets - the driver did not attempt to cover his dirty boots or offer to remove them as he tramped through the house to the kitchen. He put his power tools on my new working surface which sent off a warning to me about lack of respect and simply stated 'after the day I've had I'm not attempting to fit this' - he said the fittings to the very accessible hoses were fitted too tightly, strange as I didn't see any attempt to loosen them, particularly as his tools never left my pristine work surfaces! My husband pacified me by stating that given his mood, it was better the delivery driver didn't attempt the installation work in our home!!The situation was compounded by the frustration of contacting the service centre to obtain the £45 refund for the failed fitting/recycling. Lots of options to select on the keypad but strangely not one to match my straightforward requirement - shocking call management. I finally returned to store for the refund which was issued but without any desire to understand the issue other than to state that I must realise that 'our guys are installers not plumbers' - what a wonderful get out clause. My dining room now has an additional feature, until I can find a plumber willing to install the machine I remain frustrated and without a working washing machine, The machine was not even unwrapped by the delivery men as per the delivery commitment so here's hoping it is the product I expected and is in perfect working order.My advice is even if the price is a little higher, give your precious business to a local trader, otherwise be prepared to be disappointed, frustrated and time poor if you are brave enough to give your business to Currys.",2018-09-14

Problems started two weeks later, where my code for Deezer had not yet come through (supposed to be within 7-14 days of purchase) and was only received after repeated attempts at calling and being passed around their customer services. That is a service worth £90.I have also been attempting to exchange the product as they are faulty, and this has been a very difficult experience. Nearly three weeks after buying the headphones, they are out of stock in their warehouse and all across London. I have attempted going to shops where they labelled the product as being in stock, only to find they did not have them. The options I were given are as follows:1) Get gift voucher for price of headphones when I originally bought them, £50 below the current price2) Pay £50 at that moment to get exactly the same headphones I was replacing, but because the colour is slightly different they could not do a direct swap.3) Get the headphones from this store, waiting for who knows how long (quoted 2 weeks) before they return to stock, at which point the product would be passed the 30 day return policy.The afternoon of that same day, the item is still described as in stock in this shop, which is unacceptable.Now that they are not in stock in the warehouses and I do not trust that any shops will actually have them, I have no idea how long it will be till I get a replacement pair after sending them for collection.

First booking time for delivery was cancelled at 17:45 by the driver from Knowhow team to say that they could not come I wasted all afternoon waiting from 14:30. I called the customer service who advised a claim of time compensation of 25 pounds which could be claimed and authorised after the delivery, so I was reassured that in 3 days I will be delivered the dishwasher. In fact they came but now another problem came up: they are not skilled to install the machine in a metal pipe and was advised to buy a plastic which I did the same day and had to call to reschedule the booking for the delivery again. Now the third time, guess what?? they did not turn up. I called again and was told that the good is in the warehouse but no booked delivery for it.The 4 th time final the machine was delivery and though the nightmare has ended... NO it is continuing. The dishwasher is a standard integrated Kenwood brand and my previous one was Bosh. The Kenwood dishwasher did not fit well the allocated space and was told by the engineer that the Kenwood dishwasher is not fitting in because of some Maths and Physics issues which I cannot understand and that was it and with time it will get better. I agreed to try the machine for a couple of days and see how it goes. However, no better, the door became stiffer to open or close, the inside little door for the dishwasher tablet does not open when the machine works and hold the tablet inside, the dishes are not dry when it finishes working, the frame of my kitchen around the dishwasher got deformed as the machine is not fitted properly. I called them to pick it up and not surprisingly the Knowhow agent said that he cannot take the machine as needs an engineer to do it and he was not passed that the machine is integrated.Unfortunately, I still need to continue suffering this mistreatment of customers from Curry's, bear in mind my money is still with them and I have to stay under their power of complete incompetency and miscommunication within their firm and with customers.To all customers, please avoid at all price dealing with Curry's.",2018-09-13

2097,5b99d8768c83fd0b58d7588a,"I cannot begin to explain how poor the aftersales service is from Currys PC World. A very brief summary is as follows.I bought a gas cooker for a rental property I own. Currys sent an incompetent engineer out to install it. Not only was the job too difficult for him but he also went poking about in the property - which he had no business to do - and incorrectly told the tenants that the gas boiler was faulty (it wasn’t, it had been safety tested just weeks previously by an accredited GasSafe engineer). As a result I had to call a GasSafe engineer out again to retest the boiler at my own expense. Currys refused to cover the cost of this and I ended up arranging for a properly trained gas fitter to install the cooker. All throughout this episode, Currys customer services were completely unhelpful and it was only through the help of one employee in the local store that I was able to rearrange delivery of the cooker. After a short period of time, the cooker I purchased stopped working properly (avoid Currys Essential products). I was oversees at the time and attempted to contact Currys via email. They sent me an immediate response saying that my enquiry was important to them and that they would respond within five days. This turned out to be nonsense. Not only did they not respond within five days but when they did respond, their email basically said ‘we hope you’ve found a solution, goodbye’! No wonder their financial performance is woeful!

The cooker was delivered by driver not qualified to fit or remove so dumped it in my small kitchen so I cannot get to sink, fridge or cupboards. I called customer service five times, spending over 90 minutes on the phone, was made various promises of installation in two days and being called back, none of which happened. I am now being told I have to wait 9 days for installation and if I arrange it myself it invalidates the guarantee. Steer clear folks, this mob are an absolute shambles!",2018-09-12

That bottom drawer smashed as well, Currys arranged for a replacement drawer, arrived today - You guessed it ! That drawer smashed as well, I just can not face trying to ring this crowd again, so basically I am a customer who has paid for and now accepted shoddy goods because that is what you get with Curry’s, overpriced and poor quality garbage, I wonder if I will get a reply saying something like”email help@currys etc and quote CUR 24456, in other words, look at the other reviews and the replies proving that your complaint is number 24 Thousand odd !, blimey, they can not even be bothered to try and hide how useless they are!UPDATE ALERT !

Paid for next day delivery (Tuesday). Got the email confirming the date. Said would get an SMS on the day confirming a time slot. Come 1pm still not SMS - checked the tracking - says they don't have it? Called customer service but they won't discuss same day deliveries. Contacted via Twitter, was told there is an issue and maybe I'll get a SMS for the next day. First thing next day get an email saying the phone was lost in transit. Asked for the order to be cancelled as I was just going to buy it from Argos instead and was told they CANNOT cancel it until they've resolved the lost in transit issue?

2102,5b98fe318c83fd06e0bf4765,"Bought a Toshiba 49 inch TV from Currys PC world through their ebay store. It was advertised as being delivered by a 48 hour courier service. On the Monday it was marked as dispatch so i was expecting to receive it Wednesday or Thursday. I went to check the tracking on the team know how website and it was showing as scheduled for delivery on Saturday, so 3 days later than it should have arrived based on what they stated when I ordered it. So on Saturday afternoon I checked the tracking again on the Team Know how website and there was a message saying that there was a problem with the delivery and I had to phone them up at my expenses to their 5p per minute support number. Called that number and on hold for about 10 minutes to find that between me entering the correct address on ebay and it being passed over to 'Team Know How' the entire first line of the address had been missed off. I gave the correct address again and was told that Monday would be the earliest I could have it delivered. Monday came and went with no delivery so had to phone their Team Know how number again another 10 minutes on hold to reschedule to be told that Wednesday would now be the soonest I could have it delivered. Which means that assuming it does get delivered today, (which it hasn't been so far despite being promised it would be before 1pm) it will have arrived a week later than I was told when ordering it.Normally I wouldn't leave a poor review for a company because of delivery issues. But these deliveries are from the Team Know how couriers which is part of Currys' , not a third party courier firm. I am sure if they had used a third party courier such as Royal Mail or UPS I would have had my parcel a week ago as originally promised.",2018-09-12

They also made a mistake in setting a delivery to 'completed' when it never even came into my property so after ordering a replacement cooker I now have two £700 debits on my card as they have to contact the warehouse to set the original order to canceled. They can ONLY do this over email and wait for them?!!!! Are they in a cave with no signal?!! Do they not have mouths?And it could take 2 or 3 days?! To process a refund that should've happened a week ago?!!! £701!!!Admittedly 6 out of 10 agents are good and will try to actually help but to say you can only contact a dept by email even when they've made a mistake is crazy!,2018-09-12

It was easy to spend this amount of money as I got straight through to the department taking the money. Although the follow up e-mail to my order mentioned 'expected' delivery by 5 pm Monday the salesman made it clear that my order would be in my local store by 5 pm Monday. Chasing up my order on Monday after 5 pm was different. All I got was recorded messages inviting me to press various buttons and I mistakenly kept pressing the buttons asking for delivery updates and then after about 10 minutes a recorded message just said goodbye. I think this was because I needed courier numbers which I did not have. I called again and just kept pressing the button for 'speak to an advisor' and after 10 minutes I got to speak to an advisor. It seems that my kit may be delivered on Tuesday but no timeline has been provided on that day. I don't understand why Currys PC World were not honest with me and in which case I could have made the decision to look elsewhere for the equipment I needed. When I ordered I did mention to the salesman that I was under some time pressure to receive the computers. I don't expect that Currys can expect repeat custom from me. Very poor behaviour; 15 minutes to spend £1,300 and 30 minutes the next day to find out you have been lied to. Really unbelievable and shocking.",2018-09-10

Took 20 minutes to find one who preferred to check his own phone rather than see if customers needed assistance. Told item not in stock at any store but I could buy the display model. Display model scratched and shop soiled so said we would not want to purchase it. Sales person walked away. We then decided on a more expensive computer which was also out of stock. More senior member of staff checked availability and advised the item could be delivered to store within 3 - 5 days. As I needed the item sooner we said we would go elsewhere. Staff member then said it could be available next day and passed us over to another sales person. He went through the ordering process and advised item would be delivered to home or store in 3 -5 days. When told that we were advised that next day delivery was available he said there was a charge for this. Whilst accessing their order line he proceeded to ignore us and had a conversation with another staff member. We did continue with the order and paid for next day delivery but at no time did any member of staff interact or converse with their customer. We paid the £1000 and proceeded to the check out to pay for a few small items we had selected. Check out guy did not acknowledge us, pointed to card machine and only spoke when computers prompted him to offer extended warranty although we had to ask him to repeat himself as we did not understand what he was saying . We declined an extended warranty but he asked again. So we declined again. All in all staff have absolutely no customer service or people skills.

2123,5b9560cf8c83fd0bd009a9eb,I have had issues with a Samsung washing machine bought in October last year. Two failed repairs. Always having to deal with Samsung direct as is their will. This time I refused. Went in to Currys Dorchester as was after a refund. The Manager was not in but Martin took my details & promised me the Manager would ring me the next day to sort. Was sceptical but a chap called Chris did actually phone me to update & let me know that they hadn’t forgotten me but was taking some time to sort. He needed to obtain an authorisation code to give me a refund. He did call back but unfortunately could only obtain authorisation for an exchange. Decided to go with this as better than what I was going to get from Samsung who seem to be quite happy to send out an engineer time & time again rather than refund you.I just wanted to say well done to both Martin & Chris who kept me updated & both did what they said they would. Customer service that I expect & not the usual empty promises.Took the 1 star off as I didn’t quite get my number one wish but that is not their fault.The new machine arrived the very next day & is now happily installed.Fingers crossed it keeps working.Thanks guys.,2018-09-09

2128,5b9501278c83fd0b58d5d02d,"I had heard that Curry's had bad customer service but I let my naivety get the better of me because I needed a new TV fast and also wanted to give them a chance. Having had a Sony 43 inch TV that had served me well for the last 4 years which had recently packed up before moving house I went to Curry's in my new location to pick up a new TV. I went around the stock and decided between another Sony Bravia TV and a Samsung model which unfortunately wasn't currently on display. I asked the staff which one he would pick and he told me that the Samsung was a great TV and customers tended to like it. I asked him if it would do everything my old TV would do, including playing media off of USB as I rely on that mostly for content consumption due to poor internet and he told me there would be no problems at all and it would do everything my old TV would do and better.Oh how wrong he was. Starting with the picture quality; it's not great. You don't expect a TV that is 4 years newer than your old TV to be worse but it most certainly is. I digress however as this is not a review of the TV. The most important part is that the new Samsung does /not/ do everything my old TV did and more. It frequently crashes needing rebooting, has very wishy-washy internet performance, and most importantly, it doesn't do well with USB media at all. Most of the films I watch from my USB hard-drive tell me that this file type will not play on this device, and if they do, the sound either doesn't work or plays in the first language alphabetically and has no option to change it. Not the end of the world, I thought, it's not Curry's fault that Samsung TVs have this problem. I'll just contact them and sort out an exchange for the Sony TV. So I sent an email within a few days of purchase. No response. I send another email. No response. I send another email with my phone number. No response. I implore them to contact me, at which point, 2 weeks after my initial email, I get a response to contact Team KnowHow via phone. I do so at my earliest opportunity as like most people, I work during the week. My first attempt to get through the mountains of phone options ends with 5 minutes of selecting choices only for the automatic voice at the other end to tell me that Samsung TVs are serviced by Samsung directly, ""Goodbye"". Yeah that's not what I was trying to contact you about. The second time I ring, I wait 15(!) minutes only for the phone call to end within 2 seconds of it being picked up on the other side after ""Hello, thank you for contacting team knowhow, how can I help? Hello? Hello?"", hang up, even though I was screaming hello back. The third time, I waited 25(!!) sodding minutes, only for the person on the other end to again tell me that I would need to contact Samsung directly and hanging up on me before I could even explain that I was still within 30 days of purchase and wanted to exchange my product. At this point after having spent the better part of an hour on the phone talking to our Robot overlords and their human underlings, I gave up and wrote this review. Avoid Curry's like the plague. As soon as you've spent your money they couldn't give a toss what your problem is.",2018-09-09

I get told I can’t get a refund because they don’t have the goods back. So? You’ve got confirmation from DPD that they have still got them and haven’t delivered, just refund me and tell DPD to return to you? Not doable. I ask to be passed to a manager who apparently was free to tell the advisor that he was on another call - but was apparently not free until 6pm to call back. She eventually hung up on me when I pointed this out. I rang back and spoke with another advisor who pretty much confirmed what the first had said but did offer to rearrange delivery with DPD and refund my delivery fee - great. She put me on hold for 5 minutes and then came back and said DPD had confirmed the package would be delivered between 6 and 10 on the Monday evening which fit around my work hours. Monday comes along. I go on my lunch break. I see a text from DPD. They’ve tried delivery but nobody was in. I call Curry’s again. Another woman answers and says she’ll speak to DPD. She comes back and says DPD can’t change the delivery slot to a late option and instead will reattempt delivery between 9-5. I found this odd because the person I spoke to on Sunday told me DPD had changed the delivery slot. I said there could only be two reasons she would say this: either DPD lied to her. Or she just lied to me. Either way, not great. She also offered to refund my delivery fee. I found this odd as well because it was already agreed with the woman on Sunday that this would be refunded but apparently she forgot to process it. The new advisor then told me I can arrange for the package to be delivered to a nearby shop for collection. Great! So I download the DPD app and then try and choose this option but can’t seem to find it. So I speak to DPD on their live chat and get told that Curry’s don’t actually allow this option. So another advisor has either lied to me or just doesn’t know anything about the company they work for. I eventually give up at this point and decide to accept defeat and I book in a delivery for Saturday (the day of writing this review).Saturday rolls around. I check the DPD app and the latest update is: your package has arrived out our Middleton branch ready for delivery today. Great! Because I’m not given a time slot, I turn down plans with a friend and sit in the flat eagerly awaiting the time slot I assume is coming. It gets to half 4 and no update - by this point I think, it isn’t coming is it. I ring DPD - despite being told numerous times via an automated message that I’ve been put to the front of the queue because I have their app, I’m still on hold for 15 minutes before I give up. Now. The icing on the cake. I get an email from curry’s and a push notification from DPD at 10 past 6 saying:“Your request to change your delivery date to Sunday 9th September Thank you for your request to change your delivery date for your CurrysPCW parcel. We can confirm that this change has been made.Please can you ensure that someone is available to sign for the parcel at the following address on this date.”I burst out laughing. My flat mate asked me what was so funny. I go to call Curry’s to tell them to stop treating me like a mug and blatantly lying to their customers. Guess what time their customer services department shuts? 6. Sort yourselves out.",2018-09-08

2134,5b93c0968c83fd0b58d59517,"Appalling customer and delivery serviceI ordered a number of small kitchen electrical a to be delivered. They were advertised as within a couple of days for delivery. When I competed the order I was informed that a couple of days was actually a week. Annoying as I was due to move house in a couple of days so the stuff would be delivered to the wrong address. So no drama- I went into my account and changed my address ensuring that it also applied to my upcoming order. I received a number of emails building up the tension and informing that my delivery was imminent- giving me a time and date, but crucially not the address. So you e guessed it, the time came and went. No email no call no Kettle or toaster. I rang up customer services after a 20min options and waiting marathon I got through to somebody who couldn’t help because he didn’t know what to do. He forwarded me to a colleague- which meant another 20min wait. This colleague worked for “large deliveries” not small. He forwarded me to a colleague. 20 mins later I get through to a nice girl, who for no fault of her own, also worked in Large large deliveries. And so also could help- which which point I lost my cool and cancelled the order and asked for my money back- this required another colleague and another 20 min wait. The complaints lady was very helpful. She explained that if I had changed the address it would not have been updated on thier side hence my stuff was attempted to be delivered to the wrong address. Thankfully nobody was in so the stuff was returned. She then informed me that standard procedure was to automatically cancel my order and refund the money! So more than an hour wasted and still no cup of tea! Then just to add insult to injury I have received a series of e-mails telling me that they are reviewing my decision to cancel the order then more to say they had reviewed and accepted. Then another to say I would be refunded - for each item! So I still don’t have a cup of tea but am being spammed by Currys to remind me of that fact!",2018-09-08
2135,5b93ab148c83fd0bd0094e5c,"The issue that I have experienced was: On 22/07/2018 I had ordered a dish washer from the Bridgend store and I was told that as my existing dish washer was a built in machine I would need to remove the plinth. I did all this on the Sunday morning and also took out my machine ready for the delivery people to install the new machine. I suffer with arthritis so it was a struggle for me to do but this but it was what I agreed to do. The Delivery drivers came and they said that the machine would have to be hard wired in so they cannot do this. I asked if they could just drill a hole into the worktop and just plug it into thee socket and again they said that they could not do this. I told them that I was not happy, then the driver jumped out of the lorry and shouted at me ""You F****** T***, F*** Off"" then said ""You better watch your F****** Back"" then he got into the lorry and started driving off and shouted ""Don't F****** buy anything from us again"". My 9 year old Grand-daughter witness all this and she is very distraught. Later that day I rang up your customer services to report this and the first person did not understand the seriousness of this and was more interested in the product rather than the event. I reported it a second time and was then given a report number. I was told that the manager would get back to me. The following day I had not heard anything so I went into the Bridgend Store and spoke to the assistant Manager. He was very apologetic and made some calls to find out what had happened. He was told that Derik, the transport manager would call me back shortly. I did not hear anything all day so I rang the manager of the Bridgend Store back to say I had not heard anything from Derik, so he chased it up again. Derik eventually rang me up and he told me that he was looking into it and he would get back to me. He was not apologetic and was very blunt with his answers. I rang up your customer services again last week and the person I spoke to did say he would escalate this but I have still heard nothing. I have made 10 emails since and several phone calls and they are not giving any satisfactory answers and told me that there is nothing they can do.",2018-09-08

The installation team couldn't have been better. However the same day the tumble drier leaked all over the kitchen. The washing machine leaked a little too. We checked the back and they appear to be installed well. The leaks came from the machines,the sump at the back of the drier is loose and we can see where the leak is coming from. Currys point blank refuse to replace them and have fobbed us off on the manufacturers. Now we have to wait a further 4 days before a phone call from bosch for the washer. Then take another day off to wait for their engineer and if it's the installation at fault we will be liable to pay an extra £100!!!! Then we have to lose more time off work to wait for hotpoint to visit. It has taken us a day and a half to get this far! Currys policy is not to call customers back so we've endured countless call centre queues which we may be charged more money for. How can this possibly be exceptable!!!

This is after I called them twice yesterday to ask for confirmation that the item will be delivered today which I've got twice from their Customer Service. On the Samsung website and other big companies, the watch is on stock so this must be a mistake from their part. Now I paid in advanced money to get an item before it went on sale, and I will receive it 2 weeks later, when I can buy it now for the same price and receive it on Monday from O2 for example.This is totally frustrating. Their website actually says the item will be available on stock soon on the 13th September even though they said it will be with me after 17th September. When I called about this, they said it was an error with the Marketing team. I will never order anything else from them. If I want a refund I still have to wait 3-5 working days even through they used my money for almost a month to pay for their goods.

We still didn't hear from them so travelled to Aintree. Eventually spoke to ""customer help desk person"" who said computer wasn't ready. After a fruitless time of asking questions and not receiving answers we decided to cancel our order for desktop Acer as we saw a notice saying there was a 21 day return policy. We thought that would be it. But they argued that the MacAfee and Office had been used and insisted that we pay for them. We had not used it as we hadn't taken computer home. The reason they gave us for the computer not being ready had been that they had not started to load it as they were waiting to hear from us. So therefore, in our opinion, the MacAfee and Office hadn't been used and we should just have our money back. They insisted we take the cards and pay and we couldn't convince them otherewise as they would not listen. We therefore took them and hoped they could be used on another computer.

Got up at 6AM as delivery could have been anytime from 7AM to 7PM!!!! Machine arrived at 2.45pm. Why can't you notify people the day before? Delivery people just interested in dumping machine. Was told I needed to get a small plastic part before they could install it. Off they go. Bought the £1.50 item from B&Q - Arranged another person to come out to me to properly fit the item. Person came (was notified of arrival time the night before this time) - fitted the item - but told me the original pipe fitting would have been fine and I didn't need to get the piping from B&Q!!!!! This person didn't test the machine. Tested the machine the next day to find it leaked from the top of draw. Was told it could be down to water pressure. Scrunching noises too... Got someone out after insisting they need to arrive before 11am. Duo who checked things out - fiddled with back of machine and altered water pressure - and did a test. Now seems to work. I will never buy anything from Curry's PC World online/in store again!!! Why can't the fitters carry small plastic tubing in case needed. I would happily have paid on the spot... why cant they test the machine is working when newly installed.. why can't timings of delivery be supplied the night before a delivery as standard.

Because I delayed in having the machine delivered by a week - after ordering online - I can't even leave feedback direct with them as they've closed the feedback page saying the survey is closed!,2018-09-07
2147,5b9283cf8c83fd05dc32f8ab,"I processed an order with Currys through PayPal Credit on the night of the 5th Sept for delivery on the 7th. The 7th arrived and I hadn't even received a confirmation email from Currys, just acknowledgement of payment through PayPal on the evening of the 5th. I called Currys today and after being on hold for 30 minutes and being transferred 3 times, I was told my order had been cancelled due to being deemed fraudulent. At no point prior to this was I informed of this through email/call and if I had waited any longer I'd most likely of not found out. I just don't think this is good enough given how a simple call/email could've resolved everything? My PayPal information all correlates to the same billing/delivery address etc, therefore, there'd be no reason it should be considered fraudulent, and when asked if I could speak to the fraud team, I was told they were just a back office operation without an email/phone, nor would they provide the reason my order was judged fraudulent as this impacts their security process, which would be all well and good however how can I know what to change next time other than NOT ordering through PayPal credit? The only solution I was given was to order through other means? Which I don't have hence my ordering through PayPal Credit which is an option on their website.I spoke to PayPal RE the issue and they seemed equally confused as myself and couldn't understand the reason for Currys refusal. So now to summarise, after having to chase them myself and being on hold for 30 minutes, I have to wait for Currys to cancel the order, despite being told they'd already done this, (PayPal confirmed they hadn't even been contacted by Currys) and wait for the funds to be back in my account, which could take up to 30 days.Given this experience, I highly doubt I'll use them again as this level of service is unacceptable.",2018-09-07
2148,5b9265428c83fd0b58d536e1,"Tuesday, August 14th 2018British Summertime is, historically, sporadic to say the least. Every morning could come with a new season of weather, but this year it has been tremendous. There are however pros and cons to hot weather in Britain, one of the main cons being the increase in the wash load per household. Because of this increase in wash load, our old washing machine could no longer handle the amount of times we had to use it, so it was time for a new one. After a brief discussion with our landlord who very graciously agreed to order a brand new washing machine for our flat, we were all set for a Summer of clean clothes. Sadly, this was not to be.Sunday, August 19th 2018This was the initial date of the delivery of said new washing machine. Excitedly, I awoke early with a briskness in my step at the prospect of fresh clothes for the remainder of the British Summertime and further. The original delivery time was 9am-1pm (a wide time remit, but as it was a Sunday, nothing else was planned).I received a message from the delivery company confirming that there was 'Good news, my washing machine would be delivered on Tuesday 21st August.' Personally, this wasn't 'good news' in my books as we were expecting it that day. So - I call the company.Apparently they had remit to change the date whenever suited them. Being a Tuesday and being in a ''regular Monday - Friday job' in Central London, it was impossible for me to be in the property before 5pm on a weekday due to being in work. I was informed that this particular company only delivered before and up to 5pm between Monday - Friday, when clearly not many, if any at all people are in their house at this time on a weekday due to being in work. So I rescheduled the order for the following weekend...Sunday, August 26th 2018I had rescheduled this delivery between 9am-1pm on this Sunday. I received a missed call from a private number at 9:57am, to which no voicemail was left or no follow up call 2 minutes later, which I personally would have expected considering they were delivering a washing machine.1pm comes and I have had no update on the washing machine, so I call the company. They inform me that they will call the warehouse who can get hold of the driver and get back to me on my personal mobile number as soon as they have an update for me. Fantastic - there is a light at the end of the tunnel.However - after doing this no less than 5 TIMES, I had no call back.Eventually, now at precisely 16:42 (hours after our proposed and agreed time slot), I get through to an employee at the delivery company, who for the sake of this review we shall call 'Dave.' Dave was actually extremely helpful and promised he would call me back after speaking with the warehouse - I put my faith in Dave as he seemed like a decent bloke.He called me back to inform me that the delivery drivers were ;unable to fund my address.' I asked Dave to repeat what he had just said, so he repeated himself, to which I then explained iun a very frank manner why on earth had I not been called more than once off a private number to direct them to my property (by the way, it is a GINORMOUS building and physically impossible to 'not find'). Dave stated that I should not expect delivery drivers to call me every 5 minutes to route them to my location - I understood this to some extent as they have other deliveries they are expected to do that day, however it wasn't now 5 minutes, it was 6 hours, and I had heard nothing. After plenty of to-ing and fro-ing with Dave, we eventually agreed to reschedule the delivery for a third and final time for Saturday 1st September.***If at this point you think the above is slightly ridiculous from a delivery company, you are about to witness a spectacular series of events***Saturday, 1st September 2018I had agreed with Dave to schedule this delivery between 9am-1pm this day as previously discussed, so awoke early in order to prepare myself for a brand new washing machine. This company went one better - they called me at 8am. I was in utter shock - they were early, stating they would be at my address by 8.30am or so.They arrive.They bring the new washing machine up to my door (I live on a top floor flat).They unplug my old washing machine, take it back down the complex stairs, and start fitting the new washing machine into my kitchen whilst I am sat in the lounge.It is worth reiterating at this point that we have not had a washing machine to clean our clothes for 2 whole weeks - this is a substantial amount of time, I'm sure you will agree.About 15 minutes go by and I hear a feeble 'excuse me sir' from the kitchen, so I go into the kitchen.I am told by the fitter that this 'brand new washing machine' is faulty, as when it is turned off, water still pumps into the machine and there is no way of stopping the flow of water into the machine, even when it is off. I am then told by the second fitter and delivery driver that I now have 3 options:1. Keep this faulty washing machine, call out an engineer MYSELF AS THE CUSTOMER TO PAY FOR THE FIX2. They can take this faulty machine back to the depot and re-schedule a new machine to be delivered at a (further) later date3. Take the machine back and bring my old one back up to the flat and carry on using my old machine whilst they redeliver a new, working machine.Obviously, option 1 and 2 were a no-go, as it would mean being left completely without any washing machine in my flat - so I had no choice but to go with option 3. After choosing option 3 and stating this to the 2 fitters/delivery drivers, here was the response:'See, that would normally be a good option, but what's happened is that we have dropped your washing machine whilst taking it down the stairs and it is now completely and utterly broken and unusable.'So option 3 was not an option in the first case?And also, the new washing machine didn't work?So, they proceeded to take the new washing machine they had brought into the flat to install back down the stairs (I am still waiting on an apology for the ;slight inconvenience') and put it into the van where our previous washing machine was also sat in tatters (I only have their word for it, they may have just decided to keep it for scrap and make a few bob out of it).In summary - after buying a new washing machine and waiting 3 weeks for it to be delivered, not only do I not have a new washing machine, I have also had my previous washing machine taken away, never to be seen again.For a business to deliver brand new goods and to arrive at the customers property, and then LEAVE WITH BOTH THE BRAND NEW PRODUCT AND THE CUSTOMER'S OWN PRODUCT is nothing short of genius.I now have absolutely no washing means whatsoever in my flat and am back to square one.Do not use this company.",2018-09-07
2149,5b9179288c83fd0b58d4f828,Tried to buy a Samsung qled TV from currys online with my creation account and everything went from bad to worse first thing that I noticed was a lack of a confirmation email and when I call they said that a problem had happen with the order but when I checked my creation account the money had been taken out then when I called again they said I had to call creation I did and they told me it was currys problem when I call currys again they finally found the problem after a week and more calls and then said that it would take 1 more week for the money to be sent back to my creation account by this time the TV had went up in price so I called again just to be told that If wanted it at the price original price that I would need to go into a store I finally found myself unwilling to buy the TV or anything from currys in the future after 2 weeks trying to buy online to be told to just go in store that was me done with them.,2018-09-06
2150,5b91748e8c83fd0bd008b493,Very Very Rude and disgusting behaviour.Went to buy an attachment to a dishwasher and a laptop. Bought the attachment to the dishwasher when suddenly One of the staff stared screaming at a lady who wanted to buy a remote. He stated banging his hands on her item. His behaviour was very intimidating and to some extent violent. This put me off and I only paid for the dishwasher attachment which I had in my hand and I didn’t feel like asking anyone for help regarding the laptop. Truly disgusting and very offensive.,2018-09-06
2151,5b914e848c83fd0bd008a012,"I went to Currys to buy a computer. I had to wait an age to be served and eventually found myself an agent to help me after being told numerous times by a manager that they'd be ""with me soon"". After much thought and on their advice, I was convinced to take a certain brand lap top and to bring my old lap top in the following day for a trade in to get a discount. I explained that I'd driven a long way - asked if there was another way to get the discount to avoid coming back, but no...there wasn't. The next day I returned to the store as I was asked to do, with my lap top. This time I waited nearly an hour to be served. There seemed to be unoccupied staff milling about everywhere chatting, picking their nails, looking at their phones etc, but nobody ""trained"" to help me apparently. I eventually was served and went through a long and convoluted process to trade in my laptop only to be told that the one I wanted, which I'd been advised to chose the previous day and was still on display for sale in the store, was not available and could not even be ordered. Why on earth would they spend all that time and effort to advise me to buy a product they do not have and are not able to order? I was told that they ""have to"" have the range on display even if they can't sell it. This is not only insane, it is extremely poor service.",2018-09-06
2152,5b913b1b8c83fd0b58d4d6d7,So basically Curry's are advising customers to go against manufacturers recommendations by showing misleading width requirement information on fridge freezers and employing sales people that either don't appear to have been informed of manufacturers requirements or they are deliberately disregarding them. Manufacturers issue installation instructions concerning installation width requirements and on stand alone fridge freezers it is often a minimum of 50mm on the sides and 25mm clearance on the top. I thought Curry's would be appreciative of me pointing out that their typical notice showing 600mm clearance requirement on a 595 mm product ( just 5mm clearance so not according to manufacturers instructions) would be gratefully received and that they would immediately retrain their staff and alter their misleading notices. Apparently they don't give a damn! Don't be suprised if your product packs up after a few weeks because you shoe horned into position and don't be surprised if Curry's don't honour the warranty either.,2018-09-06

Towards the end of the delivery slot I received a call from the delivery people saying that they weren't going to be able to deliver to me, or to two other people in the locality, as they'd brought a van that was too large. A LOGISTICS company which doesn't work out what size of van to bring!No one got back to me to tell me what was being done to resolve the problem and, when I looked at the tracking details again, I found the 'Next Day' delivery had been rescheduled for two days later(!).I rang Curry's 'Customer Service' and - after a very long wait and lots of 'Press 1 for this, 2 for that' nonsense - got through to a unhelpful and 'broken record' type who wasn't about to give any customer any service if he could help it. He said that I couldn't have a refund until the washing machine (which, of course, I had never even seen let alone had in my possession) was returned to Curry's.Never again.Save yourself a lot of agony and don't shop with Curry's.",2018-09-06

When no delivery was made I feared the worst. Checking my emails I found a curt advice that the order had been cancelled. The email was sent within the delivery period. No explanation, no apology, no suggestions for future delivery etc. I don't check emails constantly and I wasted good part of the day waiting for the non delivery when a company more concerned about customer service would immediately has phoned me or texted me. Non delivery didn't stop them taking my money though! Took me three days to get it back, despite phoning them about it. Unusually for me I send a formal letter of complaint (they make sure you can't complain by email) and I wasn't in the least surprised that it was totally ignored.You can make your own choice but as far as I am concerned I will not have dealings with a company so contemptuous of its customers.",2018-09-06
2156,5b91132d8c83fd03242258a1,"Further Update:THEY DECLINED MY RETURN REQUEST!!!!! Even though when I called Team Know How and the person who responsed to my complaint told me I could do so. They even instructed me where to drop off my item to return, issued me with the return label. Only when they got my laptop and microsoft office software back to their store, they DECLINE to return the money for me!!!!! Wha the hell!!!! The laptop was still in the box, I didn’t even open it. The Microsfot Office code is still unscratched. This company is a thieve! Avoid at all cost. They are giving me headache from the first day of making the purchase till now, they can’t stop pissing me of and wasting my time to call them, write complaint, etc. What kind of business is this? I wonder why they can still survive with such a rubbish service!————————————————-Horrible delivery service, horrible attitude toward customer! I order 3 items from them on 30th August 2018: a laptop, a mouse and Microsoft Office software. Only the mouse and the software arrived, which made me worried whether the laptop being missing. I called Team Know How on 3rd September, got an answer that the laptop should be delivered the next day, which wasn't true.On 5th September I made another call, got an answer that they need to check with the deliver company which is DPD. I asked if I can hold the call to wait for the answer, got an advise that they will call me back when they get an answer. I waited for the whole day, no call back. So by late afternoon, I called DPD directly with the tracking number of my item. I got an explanation from them that the last scan for my item was on 1st September, and they didn't know where's my item now. They will raise a search and told me to call back the Team Know How to explained the situation. I called Team Know How immediately, got a suggestion that they will got an authorisation that the item is lost in transit and I had two option: to order for redelivery or to get a refund. I asked him how long would it take to redeliver, as I urgently need the laptop for my brother prior to the start of his school. They said that it wouldn't be until next week. So I chose to get a refund and we ended the call.The following day, which is today (6th Sept), I went to their store next to my area checking if the laptop is available in store, which is not. I got an advise from the staff that I could request the laptop to be redelivered and collect at the store the next day. So I gave Team Know How another call just to check if I can change my refund request to redelivery to store as the staff in his company suggested, but only if I could get the laptop within this week. I got an explanation that it is impossible, so I decided to keep my request to get a refund and asked how long would it take. The staff took a while to check and come back suggesting me that my laptop should be delivered by tomorrow. And I asked him to confirm when he said ""deliver"", he meant I will get the laptop the following day, or it just mean it will be dispatched and will take a few day, just like how the person answering my call on 3rd Sept said? My question was as simply as: ""So does this mean I can get my item by tomorrow?"". And all of a sudden the guy shouted at me in a very rude way: ""I have told you, what else do you want me to say? I am trying to Google what is the best way to explain it to you"". Even if I am the most stupid person in the world, or if my English is not good, I am still a customer and if I don't understand what you mean, you need to explain it to me in a better way, not shout at me over the phone. I was extremely calm and even have to told him to calm down, but he didn't. My question was very clear: ""So does this mean I can get my item by tomorrow, physically?"". All I need from him is an answer, Yes or No. Not a full long explanation which doesn't make sense and in a high tone like he is mad at me. When I simply ask a question. Given that I am already very frustrated for my item being lost in transit, giving multiple calls to his team and DPD, I need a guarantee that I can get the item otherwise I would cancel the order and go for another company! And cancelling and requesting for my refund was my initial decision, so if he wants to change or suggest me for another option, he must explain to me clearly what it is! Is this the service I am supposed to receive after paying over £700 for the total order? And the worse thing is that he doesn't want to stop the argument he created himself, I had to stay that: ""Ok, can you please proceed with what you have suggested, I just want receive my item tomorrow"". He still continued: "" I am working in the Head Office, I am not working in the store, I did what I could and you have to wait for them!"" Oh my God, doesn't he understand he is representing for his whole company? When I said ""you"", I mean Currys PC World, not him personally. I seriously don't understand why there is such an unprofessional person.The overall experience was so horrible, I still don't receive my laptop, still don't know if I can get the item by 7th September - which I guess this was what he meant though the more he said, the more I am confused now, and I still can't even get a refund! I feel like I am stuck with this company just because I already paid for the order. I wouldn't bother to give a review here, but after that call, I really need to tell my story to everyone in order to avoid this company!I went to Dell website and the same laptop costs £100 less than the one I ordered. Should have gone with them!",2018-09-15

Told soundbar and speaker not in stock but would be ordered for delivery and that would be Wednesday 05/09/18.TV was delivered quickly but when opened had a smashed screen so was re boxed up and Currys contacted after 25 minutes on the phone was told that i couldn't get it collected by them as I purchased in store and if I wanted the same TV I would have to wait weeks which was no go as I had gotten rid of my old TV. I had to go back and get refund/exchange from the store a 40 mile round trip! I did this and had to again re arrange collection of the broken TV and delivery of another new TV, this took nearly 40 minutes just to sort out the exchange. so far took over and hour to purchase a TV in store then 25 minutes on a phone to be told they cant do anything then 40 minutes to get an exchange!!!. So far so good NO the items they told me would be delivered on Wednesday the 5/9/18 have not been delivered to store and they think maybe Friday or Monday but cant be sure as they don't know what is on the delivery truck. I had asked for them to be delivered with the original TV but for some reason told they had to be delivered to store which is a bit stupid if you ask me.

Having placed the order for the speaker (my first order with Currys in well over a year) I didnt expect there to be any issues. Just three hours later my order was cancelled due the the item being 'out of stock'. Whats even more unbelievable is that the item appeared in stock again not long after I received the cancellation email. According to the members of hotukdeals who ordered the speaker the second time around, they have received tracking details from the courier. The Currys website is a shambles and its disgusting that they would cancel the orders from those who placed them first and then make the same product available again straight after.

2163,5b8fe6f68c83fd0b58d46133,Went to look at cameras in the Currys/PC world store in the Pontarddulais retail park branch in Swansea. Sadly the cameras I wanted to see (which showed online that they were on display and in stock at the store) weren’t there and there was no-one around to ask. Although there were several customers looking around the camera and phone sections I didn’t see any member of staff approaching any customer and asking whether they could help. There was one member of staff sitting in the corner on her own but she didn’t approach any customer. I then picked up some photographic bits and pieces and went to the till to pay. No-one there – all tills empty. Several IT staff were at the collection point counter along with another member of staff and a customer. Another member of staff was talking to an IT person in the background. I stood there for a long time feeling like a complete idiot just waiting to be served. Tbh I felt like leaving the stuff I wanted to buy and walking out - as was stared at a few times as though I had horns in my head. Finally the person talking to the IT member of staff came over and I paid for my purchases. I then popped to the Argos store next door and bought the camera I wanted. I think some of the staff there don’t get the fact that to keep their jobs and the store open they need to sell stuff!!Also if a Currys store doesn’t have an item in stock they can’t order it instore and take payment for it from the customer. The customer has to go home and order the item online themselves and either get the item delivered to their home or to a store. This is just crazy.,2018-09-05

Was kindly offered to come back to store and buy a fire stick to make the TV ""smarter"" I would rather set my money on fire than give you another penny.. The TV is useless as a smart TV and I could have spent a lot less buying a regular TV and a fire stick. This TV was for the bedroom and I've just spent over £1k on a new one for downstairs as well from argos and I will not bother coming here again. They don't let you review their products and people are specially selected for their opinion on the products they sell so you'll never get a true picture of what they're selling you.. Overall a very shady company with rude customer service. They laughed down the phone at me, ignored my email and the dismissed me on Facebook when I raised my complaint there.--------Update: it's still my fault for not checking amazon prime is available on a ""smart"" TV and I'm still welcome to purchase a firestick, thanks curry's, I'll bear that in mind, you're so kind and helpful!

I phoned the Knowhow people (I took out a service agreement) and was told that before they could change it I had to do some tests on the TV with them which I did and because it was an intermittent fault I was told that I had to wait four weeks to see if it happens again and then phone them.It happened intermittently and I made a log and then phoned them when I was told to. I was told that it will be booked in and it will take a minimum of five days turnaround - this means that my parents are without a TV for an extended period and being disabled this is important as it is difficult for them to get out.I asked for a full refund so that I can go and purchase one somewhere else and was told that I am not allowed as it has gone beyond 30 days (although I reported the problem well within this timeframe).Under the Sale and Supply of Goods and Services Act in am entitled to a full refund due to the product being faulty but Currys are refusing - I am being told by Currys that their company policy superceeds any law - the only positive part of that is that I am going to have fun watching the judge question the company representative on this as I have now no recourse but to take them to court.The company has two mottos ‘Tough it is now yours’ and ‘Currys - Where laws do not apply’.I urge you to avoid this company at all costs - AO customer service is outstanding.,2018-09-04

2178,5b8da5e18c83fd0bd0076a86,"This is a review about the branch in Milton Keynes currys pcworld. Unfortunately I had the displeasure of their rude and disgusting behaviour I had to endure when picking up my laptop that had been sent for repair. Waited in the que for 25 mins with no apology and when actually giving my details I was told I needed I needed the form I was handed that I was not made aware of at any point, I had a text to confirm to come and collect and a call and at no point was this mentioned. This was not actually the issue tho, I had one member of staff talk about me in front of me to the the girl serving me and telling her"" tell her if she wants her laptop she has to bring in her proof or she can't have it!""I did not appreciate being spoken to in that manor as would any other customer. The girl behind the counter then asked an apparent manager who also was there who was happy to write out his email but not even look At me and apologise at any time which I found extremely rude. Then when I went back later with my form he walked away when he saw me. Kev Watson was not actually the manager of the branch and the staff and himself were trying to avoid me actually speaking to a manager, the short girl sia was extremely arrogant and rude as was murna , they did not smile once or apologise once just plain rude and I feel sorry for any other customers that have to deal with staff like that. Just a little smile and friendliness goes along way and would have avoided all the agg they gave me. Quick to sell you something but the Aftercare appaling!! I won't be shopping there any more as I think I'd rather shop somewhere else, am already regretting the purchases I made this year with them. Seriously currys get better staff. The most disgusting behaviour I have witnessed ever from a shop! .",2018-09-03

2180,5b8d39958c83fd0bd0073a46,"Just over 3 years ago I paid £649 for an LG washing machine from Currys. After paying £47 to try and repair it was told is was obsolete because they do not keep parts for that length of time!! I tried to negotiate a fair settlement with LG but it was not to my liking. I spoke to Trading Standards and was informed I had to go to Currys as it was them I had he contract of sale with. I sent 2 letters which were both ignored, I then called into the store and spoke a guy that was very helpful and sympathetic, he had to contact head office. Some time later, after contacting the store again, I received a phone call from a woman who said she was team Knowhow, she did know anything only to keep repeating herself saying they would not even consider dealing with me which is probably why she did not the answer to any question asked. Over very many years I have spent thousands with Currys and quite frankly I am disgusted at their attitude and response. Money, Money, Money is all they think of. My friend bought an Apple I Pad from them and paid £40 for team Knowhow to set it up for her, she had to go to Apple who said they mucked it up - team Knowhow!!!!!!! I purchased another washing machine from AO who were cheaper, delivered, fitted all on time in future I will never give Currys any thought when buying electricals. They have been totally negligent inasmuch they should tell customers that LG machines are obsolete after 2/3 years, and if you buy anything that goes wrong they could not care less..Think very carefully before you buy from Currys It is best to go elsewhere.",2018-09-03

Two emails to Currys customer service, and several attempts at reaching them by phone, and we have had no response at all. We are entitled to have an undamaged item delivered, but how are we supposed to resolve the issue if they won't communicate?

2183,5b8cf3b58c83fd0b58d35d8e,"An endless sequence of problems.1. We bought a dishwasher and despite several confirmation messages, and have charged us for it, we received a call 7:15 in the morning to tell us that they were short of stock and postponed the delivery to the following day.2. Later in the day, the driver called to say he was nearby. We question the fact that it had been postponed it took about an hour for him to confirm the appliance indeed wasn't in the van.3. We had to make quick arrangements to be able to receive it the following day. The driver called before the delivery asking for directions. The delivery address is a Zone 2 London Postcode, you can easily find on any GPS, there was no need for such a waste of time.4. When they arrived, they told the person who was receiving it, that the old dishwasher they were paid to remove was an integrated one (it was not [4.1]) and they were not allowed to touch it (not my problem, they should provide the service they agreed to [4.2]) 5. ... and left without installing the appliance.6. I ended up spending my Sunday installing it myself. And disposing of the old one.7. Even though they said they would call us back about the ""issue"", they never did and we had to spend over half an hour on the phone to claim a refund for the service they didn't do.8. Not a word of apology was uttered after all of this.So, in summary. It's a company that can't track their own inventory or what's on the Van. That send their drivers to deliver things they are not carrying. Whose installers make quick convenient conclusions to avoid work and that are unable to apologise for the endless trouble they cause.Avoid at all costs.",2018-09-03

2189,5b8ad86c8c83fd0b58d2fbdb,"The customer service from this company reaches a new low. We purchased a new washing machine from their Nuneaton store, collecting it ourselves and fitting it two days later only to find it didn't work. It wouldn't even switch on, we checked our plug socket and the fuse in the plug, all OK. A call to their ""knowhow"" help line proved to be nearly an hour of wasted time (most of which was on hold). I asked if I could take the machine back to the store for an exchange or refund, nope, seems you're not allowed to do that! They can sell you a faulty product and you cannot return it? I got transferred (after 35 min) to a rather unhelpful chap, who informed me I needed to book a visit from a Hoover engineer, but he couldn't do that as I shouldn't have been put through to him! Strange, because I never actually asked to speak to him, the first CS person just transferred me. Anyway, it seemed I had to be transferred again to Hoover to book in an engineer to fix a brand new washing machine that never worked in the first place. I hung up deciding to take the machine back to the store anyway. When I began to pull the machine out our kitchen fuse tripped, once the machine was out I noticed the power cable that went into the top corner of machine was loose and the cable came out! It seems it was never clamped in or even connected as the clamping screw was missing, meaning when the machine was plugged in there was a bare live wire free to move around, it obviously touched the case of the machine and tripped our MCB. Atfer isolating the supply, removing the top of the machine (3 screws 2 of which were loose!) plugging the spade connectors on the power cable to the correct terminals inside the machine, it worked. It seems Hoover's quality control system failed, which could have resulted in someone (me) being electrocuted! It's shocking to know just how unhelpful and obstructive Curry's CS system is with what could have been a life threatening situation.",2018-09-01

2194,5b8a69c48c83fd0b58d2dcdd,"If I could give zero stars I would. I discovered on return from holiday on Saturday 11 August that my American style fridge freezer had broken. My husband and I went to Currys on the following day (Sunday) to buy a replacement. We explained that we live in a 4 storey town house and that our front door was up 13 steps on the first floor. We were assured this would not be a problem for delivery - my husband checked this several times and asked the sales person to make a note of this on our order. We paid in full with the expectation that the fridge freezer would be delivered on the following Wednesday (15.8.18). We are a family of 5 and it is extremely inconvenient to have no fridge. On Wednesday at 7am my husband received a phone call from the Curry's delivery team, knowhow. He was advised that we would not be getting the fridge freezer delivered as ""you have 13 steps and we do not deliver up steps"". He was told the order had been cancelled. This was surprising to us as the shop staff had said our steps would not be a problem. I went straight to the Currys store and asked to speak to the manager. He seemed surprised that the order could not be delivered - he were not aware that steps would be a problem. A staff member spoke to the ""customer champion"" who said that the order had not been cancelled but the delivery men would have to do a risk assessment on arrival at our property. I explained that if they felt they could not fulfil our order I needed to know straight away as I wanted an immediate refund so I could go elsewhere to buy a fridge. I was assured that the delivery would be coming at 12 and I was told that they could see no reason why the (presumably trained) delivery men could not carry this item up the steps to our front door, and into the kitchen. My husband then phoned the store to clarify the situation as he had been told by knowhow that the order had been cancelled. He was assured that the delivery would be happening. Reassured by this we decided to hold off ordering a replacement from a different company.When the delivery men arrived one of them got out of the van and told my husband that they would not take the fridge into the house as ""you have 13 steps"". He said they were only allowed to carry heavy items up 5 steps. At this point I was extremely annoyed. My husband and I both returned to the Currys store and again demanded to speak to the manager. A different manager appeared. Again he was very apologetic (and clearly embarrassed) but this did not help our situation. My issues with Currys are as follows: 1. We ordered the item in good faith expecting there would be no problem with delivery having checked several times with the staff. Either they are very badly trained or there is no communication between the sales and delivery parts of your business. This is incompetent. 2. On returning to the store on Wednesday morning after being advised my order had been cancelled there was again a different messages given to me by store staff as to the delivery team. This is confusing for customers. At this point I had an opportunity to order a fridge from elsewhere for delivery the following day but lost this chance after being falsely reassured that the delivery would make place. The store staff were not aware that 5 steps were the maximum number the delivery men could carry an item up (this seems utterly bizarre to me - what happens with flats?). I wonder if this is true or just a line spun by the delivery team. 3. I asked the manager to contact me regarding this refund and also a full explanation as to what went wrong. This has not happened.4. I raised a complaint through Resolver and received a wholly unsatisfactory response advising me that 'We reserve the right to not complete your delivery and/or connection if it could cause injury to our delivery crews or you, if it could cause damage to your property, if there is insufficient access to your property or it falls outside of the technical connection requirements outline by the manufacturer'. This effectively means that Currys can decline to deliver even if you have been open and clear about any potential delivery issues. So what’s the point of taking the risk of ordering from Currys?To put the matter into context, after leaving Currys, my husband and I went to a local store in Gloucester and bought an American style fridge freezer. It was delivered 2 days later by 2 men who removed our old fridge and installed the new one. All with a minimum of fuss. And a smile and I was treated as if they wanted my custom. Guess which company I will be using in future? I had expected a full apology for the extremely poor service and an apology for the waste of my time (I had to take a day of annual leave to stay at home waiting for a delivery and I also had to make 2 extra trips to Currys to try and sort out the delivery issues) I could have ordered from a different company on Sunday 12 August and had a fridge delivered in 2 days. Going to Currys led to me having longer without a fridge which was inconvenient. I would never recommend buying from Currys.",2018-09-01

2196,5b8992128c83fd0b30ba305a,"Currys sorry but your misleading trade in campaign and poor customer service is a result of your low score. I today stupidly bought into the laptop trade in scheme on line after reserving a Mac book air for my daughter.Excitedly I went to the store with the trade in laptop: please note at this point the website does not provide any descriptions of what is or not accepted as wear and tear like a car rental company or a lease car company with what I believed met there requirements. Thankfully my daughter was in the car and did not come into the store. As soon as i went into the store I felt like I was a criminal with the first employee (female dismissing me and asking her colleague to come over).James very kindly came over and I felt that I had to start again which I should have realised was a warning that the employees do not like the scheme and it becomes obvious that the misleading campaign is to entice people into store, offer them a lower trade in and sell them up.After a painful 10minute examination of the laptop I was told that the damage (2 small in dents on the lid only) were not acceptable. No other explanation and offered £20. I have never felt so undervalued as a customer and felt to feel like I should be honoured to be served. I was also annoyed with myself that I could have even been bought into this scheme in the belief it actually works for a customer. As a valued Apple customer I also will be complaining directly to them as I am sure they would be mortified to think a licensed seller misleads there Customer base.Thank you Carrie for your automated reply. I note as with many other reviews here you ignore the poor service that your organisation provides and how your team are poorly trained in providing customer service. I can see why Apple and John Lewis continue to strive ahead. As initially offered I am more than willing to join/support your customer interaction development group that the majority of global organisations now have to improve their standards.I will be going to Apple this weekend where I should have gone in the first place to enjoy good customer service, an education discount and free wireless beats for my deserving daughter who also understands how to treat people.Sorry Currys but the days of misleading advertising and up selling by stealth are long gone were in 2018 were the consumer expects transparency and fairness. I will be reviewing the campaign in more detail and reaching out to the advertising standards authority and office of fair trading to ensure this does not happen to others.I am frustrated but this could have been handled in a more professional way and I am more than happy Currys as consumer to support your evolution of the campaign to ensure that others do not end up feeling like I do this evening. Unfortunately I have posted on here as all the store offered when I tried to complain was a generic email address and the 1980’s story that the manager was on holiday.Carrie Thank you for your generic response and unfortunately as with the majority of responses you have ignored the customer feedback. In 2018 you can see why organisations such as yourselves struggle to deliver customer service standard similar to Selfridges and John Lewis. You have ignored the end users experience and focused on terms only.",2018-09-01

2199,5b89563c8c83fd0bd00656fc,"We bought a Kenwood KSBX17 fridge freezer from Currys in November 2017 and it started to go make loud whirring noises in July. By August the sound was too intrusive and so we logged it as a fault with so called ‘Team Know How’ on 10 August. Finally, on 30 August it was fixed, but the service from Customer Support was terrible in every important respect. I would never buy from Currys again.Whilst the staff in the store were good initially, the after sales are awful to deal with - call centre mentality, no customer focus. Legally, they have 28 days to fix it and they never once showed any sense of urgency. In all, we spent over three hours on the phone to Team Know How, the customer care company which Currys use. After a lot of fruitless phone calls waiting in queues to speak to people who did not take any initiative with regard to helping the customer we were finally told on Thrs 23 August that the repair would be made some time on Friday 24 August. I took a day off work as the advisor could not be time specific about when exactly the engineer would be there. No engineer turned up. The advisor did not check to follow it up. When I called on the Friday pm to see if the engineer was definitely coming I had to wait for 40 mins in a phone queue. I eventually gave up. This cost me a day’s pay. I posted a review on Trustpilot after this and immediately someone from Team Know How contacted me by email. You can draw your own conclusion from this. Mine would be that they are only interested in a customer’s bad experience in so far as it might affect their reputation. Since they had contacted me and expressed a willingness to try and resolve the situation - and because I had an email contact to correspond with as opposed to having to call a phone line and wait for lengthy periods – I removed the review. I wanted to give them a chance to sort the issue.However, the person at Team Know How, though polite, was next to useless. He did not have the facts of the case clear. He could not tell me exactly how long it would be before the engineer had the part. He offered little but vague reassurances. In effect, he did nothing that made any difference: he did not call the engineer to chase up the job nor give me a clear date for the repair. He offered the usual platitudes such as:'Whilst the overwhelming majority of problems are able to be resolved within a few days, in some instances the service engineers may need to order additional parts/spares from the manufacturer.' etc etc On 30 August the engineer called us to tell us he would be coming to fix the fridge. It is now working. Currys’ systems for dealing with after sales are woefully deficient. They do not handle customers professionally and you will waste inordinate amounts of time chasing people who simply do not care if your appliance gets fixed or not. As long as they are ‘following a process’, they think they are doing a decent job.Currys outsource after care to Team Know How. The repair motor came from a company in Birmingham. The engineer is not directly employed by Currys. And none of these elements are joined up or coherent in terms of process and the availability of information. That is the mean reason for their amateur service: their processes and structures are weak.They do not even have simple documents that apprise the customer of the process of the repair – basic stuff that might reassure people that their issue is being dealt with competently. They are put to shame by John Lewis. Never again – absolutely inept.",2018-08-31

2201,5b89492f8c83fd0bd0065080,"I was served by Julie at the Portsmouth store today. I had ordered online and was in store to collect my item. I also picked something up in the store and then made my way to the Click & Collect counter.There was no one at the counter (although staff on shop floor out-weighed customers by about three to one), so i looked to the counter next to click & collect which is Customer Services. Before i had even joined the queue Julie was pointing me towards the main checkout and loudly told me to go over there. I tried to tell her that i had ordered online and needed to collect my order, however, she didn't listen and quite abruptly told me to go to the checkout. This initial interaction was unexpected, as mentioned i wasn't even in the queue at this point and was a good four metres from the counter where she stood.Once i had walked to the counter i was able to tell Julie that i had an order to collect. There was no apology or explanation why she incorrectly told me to go to the main checkout. She asked what i had ordered rather than asking for my reference number. I told her it was a hard drive she then asked my name and walked off. When she came back i asked if i could pay for my other item at the same time, she said i could and then bellowed across the store to a colleague to ask him where the fire sticks are kept (as the boxes on the shelf are empty). The colleague told her they were in a cabinet, she then walked across the store to the cabinet and back again without saying anything further to me.The final time she spoke to me was when she held out my receipt (whilst looking in a different direction) and she said ""alright?"".All round a very uncomfortable experience. I don't expect anything special in a store like Currys but i do expect please and thank you's and not made to feel like i was in the wrong or had inconvenienced them some how.I shall not be returning or if i absolutely have to, i will certainly avoid Julie.My advice to Julie would be to not assume you know what the customer needs/wants, to not engage a customer from the counter unless they are at the counter, to not shout across the store to colleagues and finally to say thank you!",2018-08-31

I Ordered the same cooker online from AO.com it was delivered and installed within 3 days.If this this wasn't enough to put us off, I ordered in the same store a Sigma 150-600mm lens for my camera, I ordered and paid in full on the Sunday they had 9 in stock at the distribution centre 35 mile away, I was told that it could be in store on the Wednesday, I tried to call the store to see if it had arrived of course there isn't a direct store number you have to call the contact centre, I called the number twice and was on hold for a total of 40 minutes before giving up, so I thought I would email customer support to see if they could find out where my order was, I got an automated email response ""Thank you for contacting Team knowhow, please be aware that this is an automated acknowledgement. Your email is truly important to us and we aim to respond within 72 hours after receiving your email.""A 72 hour response time! It actually took 5 days. try have a conversation 5 days apart. Obviously not that important. My wife called at the store to check, it hadn't arrived but she was told it would definitely be here on Sunday. On the Sunday I knew that I couldn't phone or email them so another trip to Curry's, it still hadn't arrived and they couldn't tell me even if it would arrive on the next delivery. But I was told that if I ordered it online for click and collect it would be here next day! Again I asked for a refund.No wounder there are fewer and fewer people shopping in store, when shopping online is so much less stressful experience, I will almost certainly not be using them in the future.",2018-08-31
2203,5b8936308c83fd08e849885a,"I am not getting any response at all?Went to barbican to ask to pre order the note 9 512. Was told I have to go to carphone warehouse as they can't do it. I told the manager I want to purchase it on myplan through pcworld, not Carphone warehouse. She then told me I can't do myplan in store for it and should do it on the phone. I called up and was told that I can't do myplan on the phone at all. I then travelled to Oxford Street, and successfully applied in store on myplan.Was told to come on Friday after 1pm as it would be there for me to collect as their delivery to store would be there on Thursday in order for the launch on Friday. I went to Oxford Street, in Friday for 1pm to collect. I was told that it wasn't there until possibly? Monday.I left the store and called head office, they called a few stores who supposedly had it. She couldn't get through to any store, so she gave me a list of stores who had it and advised me to visit them. (No store had it except Wembley which was reserved for a customer)She emailed barbican and advised me to go to the barbican store as they definitely had it.Went to barbican and was told they don't have it an never did and didn't receive any email, and was told that even if they did have it they wouldn't give it to me as I can only get it from Oxford Street as they took my order.Called again and was told all the previous information I was given was incorrect.Was advised to go back to Oxford Street and cancel my order so I can order online as it's again definetly in stock for next day delivery.I logged a complaint and was offered a £30 voucher as an apology, which I refused, as this wouldn't cover my cabs, trains, and wasted time, as well as all the misinformation I've been give so far by every member of staff I'd seen in person, or spoken to over the phone.Went to Oxford Street and cancelled my preorder, only to be told it's not available for delivery for any colour of the handset, even though the person I spoke to on the phone who logged my complaint and offered me a £30 voucher said it was possible, and then was told the only store who has it is Wembley and I should go there and do a new order.They tried to call, but no store ever answers so he emailed them and told me to head there.And finally got it from the Wembley store, in the rain after trecking around London all day and being given the run around, spent hours on the phone on hold, on calls for no reason. I can't actually believe that not 1 member of staff could give me correct information, all blamed each other, and that the whole of pcworld except for Wembley had 1 note 9 in stock for the launch of the latest Samsung handset, which was blamed on delivery failure. And because I was told to cancel my preorder and order again, I lost my preorder bonus of a free wireless charger.This is my original complaint number:Cc3771202Although the person who logged it still misinformed me by telling me I should cancel and could definitely get it delivered next day which wasn't true. I have yet to receive any phone call or email in regards to this 1st complaint and I am contemplating leaving bad reviews on trust pilot , social media etc",2018-08-31

Unfortunately initially the service in-store probably wasn't the best as we were sold a cooker which didn't fit our needs(we got a Smeg with a straight back and needed a cooker that could fit a gas pipe) but after that they were superb. As soon as the fitters arrived they noted the issue with the cooker that we had an suggested an alternative model. Once we had chosen that they took the original cooker back to the warehouse and helped us to organise a new delivery time for the correct model. Then when the new model arrived the the fitters(two different men) were both very nice, helpful and efficient and ensure that we ended up with the perfect solution. Good service is harder to come by now so it is worth highlighting when done well! Thanks Team Know How",2018-08-30

She was made to feel responsible for this misunderstanding when she had clearly stated before paying that she needed a full explanation of what the package included. Instore, the manager apologised but was not aware of the situation. my mother now feels upset and confused as to what happened and why she was made to feel in the wrong when it was a mistake made by the sales assistant when explaining the package and putting the transaction through the till.

Upon contacting the company, I quite quickly came to the realisation that Curry's don't care about their customers; nor their safety. Call centre staff were extremely rude and unhelpful, no continuity in relation to communication; no solution to my problem leaving me highly inconvenienced and financially out of pocket. This happened at the height of the heatwave, I lost all of the contents of my fridge freezer and Curry's inappropriate solution was to unhelpfully suggest for me to claim on my house insurance; despite the fact the fault did not lie with me. Curry's it seems are rather adept at passing the proverbial buck and dismissing valid complaints; including non-compliance of adhering to legislation.I am still undertaking complaint proceedings, but regardless of outcome; I shan't ever use them or any of their subsidiary companies again. You can measure a companies worth by how they treat their customers post purchase. In this instance I found Curry's sorely lacking.",2018-08-27
2236,5b8448158c83fd0bd004ae9d,"Would give 0 stars if i could. I ordered 2 x Samsung 43 inch tv's which were due to be delivered on Sunday 26th August. We received a message to say what time the tv's will arrive between 3.40pm and 6.40pm which was fine as we were able to organise our weekend around this.We had a call around 5.45 pm to say that the delivery would not take place because the van had broken down and that the delivery would be rescheduled for the next day. I called customer services as I would have expected that an effort would be made to provide as much information regarding the delivery the next day.The first person I spoke to and explained what i wanted kept me waiting for 12 minutes before another person answered who knew nothing about why I was calling. I was starting to get a bit frustrated - this lady - called Aleyshia - said that she would book the delivery in for a 9am - 1am delivery - I wanted more detail about the delivery but she said it was not possible. I asked that she put a note for a delivery as early as possible as we had made plans around the delivery which should have been on Sunday.We received no further notifications regarding the delivery. Today I waited until 12.30pm when I became concerned that the delivery would not take place by 1pm especially since we received no more information.I spent over 20 minutes with the first customer service agent who could not get in contact with the depot and then told me that she wasn't the right person (something to do her dealing only with large items - even though it says large item on my order/ delivery email) and she would need to transfer me to the right person . The man I spoke to next then told me that he was also not the right person and it was only because I complained about what was happening that he did not transfer me back to the original person. He kept me on hold and contacted the depot. He told me that it would be delivered at the end of the day at a similar time to the day before and that this was standard procedure when an item fails to be delivered. By this time I was and am very frustrated at firstly the lack of delivery on the specified date, secondly the amount of time it has taken on the phone to get the most basic information about the delivery. Thirdly the innacuracy of some of the information I was given and fourthly the lack of contact regarding the redelivey from the depot.It is now 7.30pm and the items were not delivered - what a waste of time!It seems to me that there is no communication between customer services, the depot and the drivers and the relaying of any appropriate information to the customer. I don't think that they care about the customers at all.It seems a very smooth procedure to purchase something but not to receive it when expected.I do not normally complain about these things but have found this experience so frustrating that I felt more compelled to do so. I work in a service industry and know how much effort we put into keeping our customers happy or going out of our way if things have not gone",2018-08-27
2237,5b8440dc8c83fd0b58d0ec5b,"Big problems with CurrysFirst they get hacked and do not let there customers know there details have been accessed.But strangely I now start getting my email battered with scam/phishing they clearly have part of my details and include them in the scam emails I receive.Next big mayor problem, currys your plan where you get the option to purchase on finance, well you can still make purchases however when you try to make payments on the yourplan site you can not even access the site.I have spoke to customer service regarding this problem and all they could say was yes there are problems but the site has been down now for weeks.If you wanted to clear your credit before the charges kick in you can not do this online as promised when you open the account.This could leave some people having problems as when you call the number you end up in a queue that can be 45 minutes wait time as they are very busy, well they would be as the site is down and does not appear to be getting worked on as there is not even a noticed displayed to inform customers",2018-08-27

You'd expect a company to take it on the chin and help customers when this happens. But not Curry. It took a week and 5 contacts with the customer services to finally book a collection for return. Had to chase them all the way, more than one hour on the phone, plus email and DM on twitter... For what? The collection date and time were absolutely not flexible (nevermind the fact I had initially paid for a 4h nominated day delivery - busy life) and will only happen in ten days time. Of course they'll keep my money until then, how convenient. And don't bother mentioning to them THEIR failure to deliver AND to provide a convenient/flexible collection will result in the customer having to take additional time off work. Tough is what I've been told by their ""fantastic"" customer service representatives.Mistakes happen, I get it. But the way the customer services handled this case was shameless, slow, and so inefficient it could look negligent. One lost customer.",2018-08-27

2240,5b83f5f98c83fd0b58d0c935,"Ideally you should have a NO STAR rating!Ordered and paid for an Essentials free-standing cooker for my daughters flat. At the same time paid for disconnection of existing oven, recycle of same and installation of new cooker. In short a full package and incidentally putting an extra £100 on the price (approx).First delivery - men arrived with cooker but according to their paperwork installation had not been requested or paid for. My daughter was able to show proof of this via an email but they insisted they were there to deliver only and could not install it. As the flat is small - the old one had to be disconnected and discarded before a new one could be put in so we had no choice but to send it back and await another delivery date.After several lengthy phone calls it was ascertained that there had been an error but I was absolutely convinced by them that a new delivery date one week later would be carried out correctly and to my specifications.One week later having waited in all day at 6.30 pm the delivery driver turned up and the exact same problem occurred. Team Know How had apparently sent another driver who did not know or want to know anything about installing the oven and at 6.30 said there was no-one we could discuss it with. He too apparently had paperwork which did not mention a need to install.How could the same mistake happen to the same person twice?I decided that the only solution would be to put my case to Paypal for a refund of my money and shop elsewhere.I wrote to Currys expressing my annoyance at what had happened and they have not even bothered to reply nor did they offer any suitable solution. It is now three weeks since I placed the order and I have heard absolutely nothing from them.If you are reading this and thinking of buying a large item from Currys - ie one that requires delivery I would advise you to think again - save yourself a lot of frustration as the installation seems to be a big problem to them - It is ironic that they call themselves Team Know How when they are blatantly seriously lacking in installation know how...",2018-08-28
2241,5b83e04b8c83fd0b58d0bfbf,"Due to have a fridge/freezer delivery today which did arrive, however delivery was refused to due steps leading to my property. Having advised curry’s of the steps leading to property a week before I was told this would be fine (thinking maybe they would just send more people to do the delivery). The delivery driver then refused delivery due to health and safety suggesting he can leave the fridge on the pavement or that I should buy a smaller one! I can understand the health and safety issue of the steps but my property is not the only one with steps and with curry’s been advised of this how does it expect people to buy appliances from them when nothing is done to accommodate this!

I received a call from yourselves to confirm the order in which i informed the caller they may want to note on the paper work i live in a flat but it is only on the second floor so not a lot of stairs. I was informed that this wasn’t a problem the delivery people were fine with stairs and all i needed to do was to ensure there were no sofas or tables blocking the delivery peoples way. I ensured this was completed and awaited for the delivery date. The delivery people arrived at about 10:20 and informed me straight away they didn’t do stairs and that the fridge/freezer i have paid to have taken away should be outside ready for them. The attiude from this person was disgusting!! I informed them i had informed the company in regards to it being a flat and was as stated earlier told this was not a problem at all, i also informed him i was not told the old one was required to be taken away and it was not the paperwork i had received. He just continued to repeat the old one should be outside and it says this on this paperwork! The New fridge freezer was brought in by the two people while he was still grumbling. They carried it into the lounge where i said to just place it as they made me feel extremely uncomfortable and like i was asking them to do more than they are required. He then repeated his complaint AGAIN about the old one should be outside and about it being on his paperwork which he then asked me to sign. i REPEATED i had not been informed of this and signed the paper work. They then pushed my old fridge over my wooden floor in the lounge, i will be checking for marks and knocked my raidator off the wall in the hallway without even a sorry as i caught it before it fell. As they were going down the stairs he shouted up to inform me i can’t plug the new one in for 6 hours. I have checked my paper work to see what information i was given to see if i had missed something as he made me feel so comforatble and in the wrong. I have since found as believed i was not informed to leave my old one out side and it even states they would take the packaging away for me! This clearly hasn’t been done, below is what the email i received states; What will be done for you?We’ll unpack your product and dispose of the packaging for you.Before we leave, we'll make sure you're happy with the work we have done.What do you need to do?Be available at the property to accept your delivery.If you’ve purchased our recycling service, please disconnect your old product before we arrive and ensure it’s free of water (fridges/freezers will also need to be defrosted). If you’ve also purchased installation, we’ll disconnect it for you.The fact your email states if your purchased installation we will discount it for you implies the old one isn’t required to be outside. I dont believe that shouting halfway down the stairs not to plug it in for 6 hours counts as making sure I’m happy with the work you have done. I am extremely disappointed with this service and how i was made to feel by the delivery guys even though i have in fact not done anything wrong and even went out of my way to inform the company it was a flat incase other equipment was required. They made me feel extremely uncomfortable and because of this i have a fridge freezer it in packaging sat in my living room. This is a service i paid for!!!!! Delivery and disposal!! There is clearly and issue with the companies talking to each other and passing on any important information or the delivery guys intact knowing what work they are expected to complete my curry. After this experience i feel like i have wasted my money for the delivery and removal and would of been better hiring a van and a man and doing it myself or in fact just going to a much better company with much better customer service!!!

2245,5b82d1df8c83fd09cc1c5665,"One star is too many! I recently purchased a laptop from the Harlow PC World store. It was a nightmare from start to finish. I had to leave the (already paid for) laptop to be set up (which I was told would take a couple of days), however it was 5 days later that I received a voicemail promising a call back but no further call and no information. I made a number of attempts to contact the store, however it is not possible to contact any PC World store directly by phone, therefore I spent a good deal of time waiting on hold to the central customer services helpline. Every time they tried to put me through to the Harlow branch, they said the phone rang out and no-one picked up. The branch also apparently ignored a number of emails sent by this central customer services team asking them to phone me. I asked to log a complaint, but was told this would not be investigated the first time it was raised, and I was given no solution other than to wait until Harlow PC World finally deigned to phone me. Ultimately, the only way to contact the Harlow store was by phoning the in-store Carphone Warehouse and asking their (very helpful) staff to pass the phone over to the PC World staff. It became clear the laptop was still waiting for set up to be completed, despite it having been with them for a week. When I finally managed to pick the laptop up, I got it home to find it had a pen mark on it and also the charger cable was missing. At this point I called the store (again via Carphone Warehouse), and fortunately I spoke to the first helpful member of PC World staff I had encountered, Sinead. She apologised and arranged for the charger to be sent to me the following day. I would never recommend anyone to shop at PC World (particularly the Harlow branch) after this absolute nightmare.",2018-08-26

I asked him to confirm using his 4"" spirit level whether the floor was uneven or the work top and he refused - obviously cause there was nothing wrong with either the floor or the worktop !! He then went onto ask me when the house was built - the kitchen fitted and so on - what this has to do with levelling the dishwasher with adjustable feet - there had been no problem with the previous 2 dishwasher we had had in situ. During this lengthly time the woman asked to use the toilet - so I was having to keep an eye on where she was sneaking off to In my house at the same time as having the discussion with the man!! I rang my husband and he had to come back 20 miles - because being a mere woman the delivery man would not listen to me - apparently I am a 60 year old idot!I asked if he was going to test the machine for leaks or even switch on the power - he said they did not test dishwasher - which is an untruth - how do we know whether it leaks or even works - he would not even turn on the power! We were also told he would not either give us instruction on how it worked. Any way we signed the delivery note as damaged and said we wanted a replacement - he offered us 10% a refund - we said return and replacement !! - I distinctly remember a discussion about new delivery dates then they left (with the voiceless woman!!)We later telephoned and eventually spoked to James in customer service who said we had agreed to the 10% which is completely untrue !!! Eventually he agreed that they would replace the dishwasher.So not only was the delivery man rude insolent and incompetent - but he was also a liar!! - If we had not phoned customer service we would have been stuck with a damaged £600 ++ dishwasherMove on 2 days - replacement dishwasher & different delivery men - & what a different experience - replacement dishwasher fitted - tested and basic instruction given - pleasant - friendly and a joy!!But I NEVER NEVER EVER AGAIN WILL BUY FROM CURRYS - I WOULD SOONER WASH MY POTS AND CLOTHES IN THE BRISTOL CHANNEL !!

2251,5b81ea928c83fd0bd0041ef1,I would of liked to of given Currys minus stars. I ordered a Samsung washing machine and a Samsung tumble dryer on 17/08/18. I chose Currrys for the next day delivery and install. While I was at work my son rang me to say the delivery men had arrived however they could not plumb in the washing machine as they are only delivery drivers but they assured me that Currys would contact me to arrange the install. At 3.30 pm on 20/08/18 I rang Currys because I hadn't received a call from them. After some discussion I agreed for the install to be completed on 25/08/18 a week after delivery. I had no choice because of work commitments. The installers arrived yesterday and I didn't realise until they had left that the machine only fills with hot water. I discovered this when I took my first completed wash load out and the washing was hot because it had been rinsed in very hot water. Also the top of the tumble dryer is broke. I was on the telephone for over an hour trying to speak to someone at Currys regarding the tumble dryer and I kept being cold transferred to other departments without being notified. I was transferred to Samsung twice. At the time I was trying to speak to and eventually did speak to an advisor at Currys I was unaware that the machine was only filling with hot water so I will have to make another telephone call which I am dreading. I have made a complaint to Currys through RESOLVER. I am now awaiting a response from them. UPDATE: I rang Currys today regarding my washing machine only filling with hot water. It took me approx 15 minutes to get to the correct department. The lady i spoke to was very helpful and an engineer is coming back tomorrow (bank holiday Monday) to install the machine to the cold pipe. Luckily my son is off work as I am not. Just for everyone's information it's not just a case of me attaching it to the cold water pipe or i would of done it myself.UPDATE; second install team arrived this morning and confirmed that they could not carry out the install 'because he's not a plumber'.The uplift number has already been provided to Currys and we are still waiting for them to contact regarding damaged tumble dryer.,2018-08-27

Later during the conversation, it became clear that this was a lie and the stock wasn't an issue but they didn't actually deliver on a Saturday. I said we couldn't be here during the week until 4:30pm and, after being on the 'phone for a long time whilst Saheed spoke with the delivery team, received confirmation that my item could be allocated a late delivery slot - I was assured that it would be delivered between 4:30pm and 7pm, but would need to be put back until the Friday. Fine.However, I then received a text late Thursday saying that my delivery would be between 10:30am and 2:30pm! I called as soon as they opened on the Friday and was assured that this would be sorted out and re-arranged, but then received several calls from Customer Services at 09:40 saying that they were trying to deliver!

I voiced my concerns (as we'd been let down after their last assurances) but was told that this wouldn't be a problem - it had been discussed and confirmed by Jack's Manager and Jack told me that he would personally track the delivery to make sure it went according to plan.Then, late on Sunday night I received a text saying delivery would be made the following morning!! The delivery driver called me before the office opened, so I wasn't able to speak to anyone about this & I had to tell him that I wasn't home and that the delivery wasn't supposed to happen until later that day.

Tues again a call to say it had disappeared the manager would look for a replcement.. a lady from the store called weds offered her same make lower spec higher price. Then lowered it when my friend pointed out it was nit dearer. So lower spec sane price. My friend said she would think about it and get back to her.

To my amazement when I got there, I was told that the offer had ended on the 17th August and that was that. When I said the offer was available/advertised on the website that afternoon I was told that may be so but it is no longer available in store (like I could do a trade-in on line)- all of this said in a smarmy I-dont-give-a-rats-behind-and-why-are-you-bothering-me tone and manner. My question of if the offer had ended on the 17th, why was it still on the website 1 week later was ignored. And then he walked off.I find it difficult to believe that in 2018 a major retailer can get away with online offers which appear designed to bait you into their stores and then refuse to honour the offer once you get there OR to not update their website long after the offer is apparently over. If you have the temerity to question staff about the discrepancy, said staff find it acceptable to treat you as if you were something they had wiped from the bottom of their shoes.

They did agree that the trade in offer was still current and expressed their puzzlement over the stores actions. To ""resolve the situation"" it was suggested that I return to the store and tell the staff that the offer was valid (did that on first visit) and to tell them it was on the website (did that on first visit too) and if they still refused to do a trade in then I could phone customer services from the store and that they could inform the staff of the situation.And now *I* am puzzled that a major retailer expects ME to resolve a situation for them - silly me, I thought that was their place as customer service representatives. I replied that I have NO intention of returning to the store to have their staff subject me to a potential second round of bad service. Throughout all this there was no apology for the behaviour of their staff. Says it all, they go through the poor reviews on this site offering meaningless replies and even more meaningless service.",2018-09-08
2260,5b807e1b8c83fd0b58d018f7,"I give it 1 star because I cannot give it any less!We bought an integrated diswasher for our new flat while the kitchen was still fitted. When it arrived, the delivery guys quickly dropped it and left without opening the package. The following day, when the kitchen installers opened it the whole side was completely smashed, as if it had been hit by a forklift or something similar.We then went to ask for a replacement and they agreed to replace it as a 'gesture og good will'. At that point they also informed us that the machine had been discontinued, so we would need to look at another one instead.We tried to ask for some advice at that point but the guy (who we soon discovered was actually the manager!) Was not interested. Looking as if we were bothering him, he printed a couple of specs for other machines they had in stock and left us to deal with it.We then went again to complete the exchange and they asked us to pay for delivery as we wanted the appliance delivered the following day, given that the installers had lost a day but were still coming the following to finish some bits. We insisted that we didn't agree so as another 'gesture of good will' they voided the £29 delivery fee. However, at that point they realised that next day delivery wouldn't be possible and they would have to send the replacement in two days. The kitchen fitter could not come that day, so we had to wait for another 5 days with a half-done kitchen and pay the fitter extra for a secon visit.After all of this, when we finally thought we were done, we turned it on for the first time to realise that it was defective: the noise it produced was louder than a washing machine in spin cycle!As we had pur hased the estended insurance they offer, we called the number they provided us where the automated system connected us directly to the manufacturer.It is the right of a customer to obtain a refund if a product shows a fault within the first 30 days, so I told the guy on the phone that I would like the machine to be replaced. He informed me that I would have to deal directly with Curry's for that (it is at this point that I realised I was not talking to Curry's despite having called their number) but they would send an engineer to assess the fault.The engineer took a week to come and when he came he said he needed to have a look. We left him to 'have a look' and 30 minutes after he came out saying that it was fixed! We didn't want it fixed, we wanted replaced, bbut we realised it was too late as it had been done.We then gave it a try and, although still noisier than I would have expected, it was better. However, towards the end of the cycle, another even louder noise started to come out, so much so that it could be heard from a different room with the door closed!I recorded a video and we decided to go to Curry's in person this time to ask for it to be replaced, where they told us that, because we had accepted the repair, we were not entitled to a replacement or refund. Instead, we needed for another engineer to come to assess the new fault and, if one was found, they would then exchange it.We were at this point very annoyed and although I showed the video where it is clear that the noise is not normal, they refused responsibility and said that without another engineer visit they couldn't do anything: the earliest appointment available for the engineer visit was in 9 day's time, on a Wednesday when we needed to take time off work as they cannot give you a time slot.We tried to complain via their customer support too but they completely denied responsibility in the same way.After this, I send several emails to their customer support team that were ackowledged by an automated email informing us that we would receive response within 72 hours. 4:days down the line there is still no answer and we are escalating it to the Consumer Ombudsman.I would advise anyone thinking of buying any appliances (or any product sold by this brand for that matter) to avoid Curry's at all costs. There are plenty other places to get appliances for the same price where they actually care about their customers.",2018-08-24
2261,5b8079aa8c83fd0b58d017e0,"I don't like giving bad reviews, but I have had no choice. I ordered a TV on a mega deal. Delivery should have been the next day, I stayed in all day, didn't show. Again the next day, didn't show. After 7 failed deliveries I finally received the TV and after 5 call back requests I spoke to a manager who offered me £50 cashback. I thought that was the end of the matter and felt the cashback dealt with the days i'd had to take off of work and sit in waiting for no show. However, upon receiving the TV it was clear the TV was faulty. I rang back and they arranged an exchange. Funnily enough, these 3 delivery attempts failed too, until last weekend I was advised the TV is now out of stock. I have waited for it to come back in stock but now they advise it is discontinued. The next TV with the same spec pricewise is £120 more. So they have offered me £22.49 off my next purchase and a full refund. They say this puts me back in the position I would have been. No, the position I would have been in at the point of contracting with them (paying online for the item) I was the owner of a specific spec TV, I am now the owner of a broken TV they are collecting and have lost days off work, staring at my wall waiting for delivery and dread to think what I have paid on my phone bill to their call centre, and I do not have from them the amount of money required to put me in the position I would have been in, with the specific spec TV nearly a month ago.

2265,5b802d768c83fd08b4cd1ffc,"An absolutely appalling experience - would not recommend at all!We ordered a washing machine from Currys online on Sat 4th August and were told it would be delivered between 2.15 and 6.15 on Thursday 9th August. At 7pm, I phoned the delivery team to ask where my machine was - it took me 15 minutes to get through to a real person. He put me on hold for 10 minutes while he spoke to the depot and then came back and said the drivers had 'run out of driving time' and were heading back to the depot with my machine. I asked why they hadn't bothered to phoned to tell me this - he did not know. We rearranged the delivery for Monday 13th August. I asked if I could have a morning delivery to ensure the drivers didn't run out of time again (!) and was told that I could only have a specific slot if I paid extra for it. I asked to be put through to Customer Services and spoke to someone there who said that, as I had been messed around, I could have a morning time slot (9-1) at no extra charge and that she would arrange it. I duly stayed in all morning - no delivery by 2.30 and no contact. I went online to track my order to find the time slot was now suddenly 1.20-5.20. As this was not what we had agreed, and as I couldn't stay in all afternoon, I phoned Customer Services and cancelled the order. I was told that the depot would contact the driver and cancel the delivery, that I would receive a confirmatory email cancelling the order within 24-48 hours, and that I could expect a full refund to my credit card in 3 - 5 working days. (Despite the order being cancelled, the lorry turned up at 6.50 pm and tried to deliver the machine - I refused it as I had cancelled the order). By Thursday 16th, I had received no email confirming cancellation of the order. I phoned Customer Services again and was told that the order HAD NOT in fact been cancelled on Monday, but that he would do so immediately and send me through a confirmatory email - sent apparently at 1.48 pm. He said I should receive it in a few minutes and that the refund should come through in 3-5 working days. By Friday 17th afternoon, I still had no confirmatory email so I phoned Customer Services again, only to be told that there had been a 'problem' sending out emails but that she would request one was done manually (on each of these occasions, I was asked to confirm that they had my correct email address). She also assured me that the refund to my credit card had been processed and was ready to send out.I left everything for a week, but by Friday 24th August (the date of this review) I had still received no confirmatory email saying that the order has been cancelled and despite regular checks on my credit card account, no refund had come through. I phoned Customer Services again and asked to speak to a supervisor but was told I could not. When I queried the absence of both the email and the refund, I was just told that the emails had been sent and that the refund had gone through and that it must be a problem with my credit card company. She said that she would request again that an email should be sent to me manually and suggested that I take the matter of the refund up with my credit card company. I suggested that, as I had never had a problem with my credit card company, it seemed unlikely to be a problem at their end - but that given that ABSOLUTELY NOTHING that Currys had said they would do had happened yet I was more inclined to blame their systems. She suggested that I leave it till next week and then contact them again.(30 minutes after my phone call today, I finally received an email confirming cancellation of the order - but as yet no refund has come through). The whole experience with Currys has been utterly frustrating and a real waste of my time and energy. I doubt very much that I will use them again.",2018-08-24
2266,5b800ad88c83fd0b58cfead3,"I have bought a tablet online, 2 years warranty included, delivered to my door. Tablet was great except that after 40 days or so I had a dead pixel. So I contact currys and they told me to go in store to have a straight exchange. The store tells me the model is not stocked anymore hence I need to ask for a refund online (so much for the 2 year warranty) or that i can upgrade by paying an extra 60 pounds for the next one up. I go home, call them and ask for a replacement and they say they don't have any to send to my address (apparently only some stores have them and they're getting rid of them) so then I am forced to ask for a refund. They tell me they'll send the courier on a Thursday to pick it up for a next day delivery to them so that I can get my refund. They come on a Wednesday with no warning so I had to quickly reset the tablet and loose some data. I get handed a slip saying NEXT DAY delivery and I am told to wait for an email from Currys the next day. Two days after, Friday, no email from Currys so I call them and they have to call the courier because they have not received the tablet yet and they won't receive it until next Tuesday because it's bank holiday blah blah and that I cannot expect an email with refund before next Thursday hence the refund will not be before 2 weeks from now basically. Interestingly they do have online stock because you can buy the same tablet on their Ebay store brand new for the same price!!!! What kind of customer support is this??? Not even 2 months from purchase and I can't get a replacement even though it's not my fault they dont' stock it anymore, I have to pay if I want another tablet or I have to wait 2 weeks before getting my money back to buy another one. Can't believe the cheek they had to blame the courier as well. Never buy from Currys again that's for sure.",2018-08-24

2272,5b7eb48c8c83fd0b58cf7d9b,"FURTHER UPDATE: In response the this review I received the following email: 'Hi Jade, Thanks for your message. I am sorry but there wouldn't be any further information that we can give you regarding the complaint you raised up due to it containing employees private informations. Apologies for thisThanks M.A'I have no idea what that response refers to, I replied asking whether it was meant for another customer but have been ignored! So the saga continues..Please see below a review I left yesterday. As you can see, Currys responded politely in a public capacity, yet when responding to my email privately they again claimed they will ignore my responses: 'Any other communication will be logged to the case reference number shown above, but may not be replied to if not containing either of the above.' They are yet to respond to my query asking how a sexist engineer was supposed to diagnose a faulty that only occurs every 4-5 washes in a 5 minute visit, I have asked at least 10 times and they avoid the question and claim tney will stop responding unless I provide 'new information'. They have asked me to pay out of my own pocket for an engineer and they may reimburse me if a fault is found. I wouldn't trust them as far as I could throw them when it comes to repaying me particularly looking at other rviews, but more to the point why should I when it's their responsibility to ensure an engineer is booked for the correct amount of time?! Currys sold me two faulty washing machines and now refuse to repair or replace. Despite me explaining from the outset that the fault is intermittent and occurs only 1 in every 4-5 washes, they sent an engineer who did not even perform one full wash before declaring the appliance in full working order.The engineer also made sexist remarks to me and my child, making me feel uncomfortable in my own home. Currys denied responsibility for the behaviour of the engineer, as he was representing the manufacturer. They then contradicted this by relying on said manufacturer's judgement without carrying out their own investigations on my purchase - which is it, are they representing you or not you can't have it both ways.I asked why the engineer stayed 5 minutes meaning he failed to investigate the fact the fault was intermittent and was told 'because he has other jobs to attend to'.. surely it's Curry's responsibility to book out the appropriate amount of time depending on the circumstances?! Obviously a fault that occurs every 4-5 washes is not going to be witnessed in a 5 minute visit so the engineers report is meaningless.The responses I've received have been patronising and robotic. I have now been told that Currys will stop responding to my emails unless I provide 'new information'. How is this even allowed - they have my money but I do not have goods fit for purpose in return and now they insist they will 'ignore me'. Grow up. They have not even attempted to reply to my repeated queries asking how a 5 minute visit equates to investigating an intermittent fault. Never mind 'new information'.. how about you address the original question!I have recorded videos of the fault and invited a rep from Currys to visit my property but they have refused to accept that as evidence. So as it stands, I'm stuck with a washing machine less than 6 months old which works only intermittently and the only solution Currys are offering is to pay my own engineer to stay in my property for the length of time required and they may reimburse me if found to be faulty. I don't have the money to lay out and I wouldn't trust them to repay me after the appalling and dismissive service provide over the last 3 months that this debacle has dragged on for. The onus is on them as the supplier to prove it's not faulty, not me as the customer to pay out to prove that it is! Frustratingly I've now had to take formal action via Trading Standards who have upheld my complaint, however I am stuck with a faulty machine until the resolution of this action, meanwhile Currys insist 'any further emails without any new information will be read but not responded to as there is nothing further we can advise'A bizarre and frustrating experience that could have been so easily resolved with one visit from a professional, non-sexist engineer who stayed for the time I advised it would need from the outset.Currys PC WorldReply from Currys PC WorldPublished 27 hours agoThis is really unacceptable Jade, apologies for the experience you had.

2273,5b7eae5c8c83fd0bd0033b27,"If I could give them 0 stars I definitely would!!!I went to the store last night and wanted to buy a MacBook Pro. So first of all one of the sale 'assistant' is arguing with me about the fact that whether Apple has a 2017 Macbook without touch bar or not! I Told him I can bet £100 that Apple has a 2017 MacBook Pro without touch bar and then he replies with all seriousness ""I give you £300 if Apple has a Non-touch bar Macbook pro"". He then goes on one of the laptop and searches for 'MacBook Pro 2017 13 inch' in the Google images!!!!!! He doesn't even check curry or Apple website. He then selects a picture with touch bar and shows it to me. Then I reply by saying if you go Apple website you can see it! After he checks the Apple website and figures out he was wrong, he doesn't even apologise, he just tells me to wait here till I go and get your MacBook. After waiting for 15 minutes, he comes out with MacBook and when I reply by saying do I get an offer on any of these MacBook cases because you lost the bet, he replies by saying I don't remember betting with you!We then go to counter and I ask him for a price match because Amazon was selling that MacBook for £83 pounds cheaper! So he asks his manager and this is when the idiot who calls himself the manager comes!First he says we don't price match with Amazon! Then when I reply by saying its on your website, it says you price match with Amazon if the product is sold by Amazon. He continues to deny this and then he goes to the Currys website to check the price promise page! After that, he replies by saying I cannot find the product in here, so I have to go to him and show him the product! He then takes 5 minutes to check everything detail by detail!After that, he comes back and says the part number is different so I cannot match it!!! I reply by saying its on the Currys Price Match app which means you should price match it!! He then says 'Im the BOSS here and this is how I want to do it!!!'. This is happening in front of 2 other employees and then they reply by saying yeah he is the boss and literally humiliating me! He then grabs the MacBook Pro from me and when I ask for his name he writes it on a paper and says do whatever you want!I then asked why is the app showing I can price match it and then replied by saying the app is wrong! So I got one question from Currys, why do you publish a faulty app which results in your employees being like this to customers? This is unacceptable Currys! If this guy is the manager of your Watford Branch then send one of your Senior Manager to Watford and arrange a meeting between me, him and the senior manager and if he is not the manager then arrange a meeting between me, him and Watford branch manager!I don't want any compensation or vouchers!

I want this guy to understand what is the meaning of customer service!The Person who said he is the manager and the boss of the shop had name tag ""Daxesh""The Person who made a bet had name tag ""Ravi""I will be waiting for your reply!

2274,5b7e7c6e14b7d8018cff266f,"Honestly, WOW. Do you employ anyone ? Firstly, Made an online order. Great ! Paid extra for delivery for Monday before 12 midday. Great ! Down hill from there. I must state, I acknowledge that I entered the incorrect delivery address. But, I changed this almost straight away via my account details online. Then, Monday morning came. 12 Midday came, Still no order. Even though, I paid extra. Then I thought I would DM both ""PC World"" and ""Team Know How"" via Twitter as i was unable to track my order. Well, pointless mistake that was. So, decided to send an email to only receive an auto response stating they will be in touch in 72 hours. Getting nowhere, the next morning I received an email from DPD to advise they will be delivering my items on the Tuesday when I was at work to the WRONG ADDRESS!! I was unable to change this through DPD ( for obvious reasons ) I tried all morning to change this address again through PC World and Team Know How and again, got nothing from anyone even after speaking to someone from the customer service department who placed me on hold for 20 minutes before hanging up on me. So, in an attempt to get a refund on the extra delivery charge i have emailed ""letusknow"" but the question is. Will I get a response ? Probably not ! Joke of a company and will 100% not be using their ""Services"" again ! Team Know How should be assumed and change your name to Team Know Sweet F*** All !

2279,5b7d808614b7d8018cfee02a,"I bought a camera costing over £600 in February 2018 together with a £139 repair & support plan. The camera developed a fault, the trouble-shooter menu on the camera said it needed to be returned. 7 days after I returned the camera I was told that I would receive a replacement as soon as I was sent a product code which would be within 48 hours. Some hope. I thought the 7 day promise meant 7 days. No it took 22 days. I had all sorts of ridiculous excuses such as "" we can't proceed until an engineer conforms 7 days have passed"". You couldn't make it up. I am out of pocket on a number of counts. Customer services repeatedly promised to get back to me and didn't. They gave me an email address to complain to. The server tried repeatedly for 2 days to deliver my email before it eventually failed. I wrote to the Sheffield office recorded delivery 2 weeks ago and no-one has even acknowledged my letter.Update 1I have emailed as requested and included a copy of the letter that I sent previously. I will give a further update regarding progress when I receive a response.Update 2I received an email at lunchtime offering 'sincere apologies for inconvenience caused' and making an offer of compensation which I do not feel fairly reflects the experience that I have suffered. I have emailed back my feelings on this. I hope that things can be fully resolved in their next email - at least I now feel that someone is dealing with my issue...….Update 3I have now been offered a small amount to cover my call charges ( for over 2 hours on the phone ) and mileage to the store having had to make repeated wasted visits which I appreciate. However I seem to be completely failing to get the point across that it is the time wasted and stress of this which should be considered as well as the problems experienced in waiting 22 days for a replacement product which I expected far sooner having paid especially for a 7 day replacement plan to avoid problems. I will email one more time before taking further advice ( having previously been pointed in the direction of the 2015 Consumer Act ) which highlights the importance of goods and services being as described....",2018-08-27
2280,5b7d7b1b14b7d8018cfedd57,"Well I guess the moral is dont buy from Currys.I bought a washing machine online for my tenant.First Delivery: They couldnt get their lorry down the road so had to reschedule. Not sure why delivering in such a large lorry in london is a good idea. Its a normal side street with traffic calming. No other companies have had a problem.Second Delivery: I had to reschedule, I specifically asked for them not to retry the next day. Went over this repeatly with the phone agent. I was assured this would not and indeed could not happen. Of course they delivered the next day..Third Delivery: They turned up, left the old one connected and dumped the new one in the hall. They claimed they didnt know what they were meant to do with it, rather than check they just left it and went. I paid for installation and disposal of the old one. The washing machine is now in the hall blocking access.Currys delivery is just unacceptable. The phone service is way too automated and is totally disconnected from the depot. They cannot tell you whats going on more than your washing machine exists somewhere. They cant even track your order when you give them the delivery number that they sent to you that morning. The depots seem to work to their own schedule thats not connected to the phone system. The delivery guys im sorry to say are just not good enough. The whole system doesnt work.Having previously bought off AO I would only recommend buying from them, not because they where that good just that Currys cannot fulfill what they sell.There is still no washing machine in this property.Even if currys is cheaper, dont waste your money.

I paid for delivery and installation and the recycling of the old white goods.Whilst they were manouvering the washing machine they ripped my kitchen vinyl flooring. It was obvious that the flooring had to be replaced rather than simply repaired. The delivery team member said that Curry's would pick up the bill. I of course then needed to remove the white goods myself into the front room - including gas cooker - and await my new floor. The delivery and installation was completely pointless. Am I going to get my money back for this - no chance.The whole complaints process is completely floored (excuse the pun). I had to pay for a new floor on the day the damage occurred as I had tenants moving in imminently. This of course means I can not simply get 'two quotes from contractors on letter headed paper'. Even when I supplied the quotes, invoices, photos etc. they phoned me back stating the invoice that I've supplied and now paid was not stating the 'full cost breakdown'. I'm never purchasing anything from Curry's again. I'm always going to shop local and avoid Curry's like the plague.

Drivers show up at 1.40pm and proceed to tell us that for health and safety reasons they cannot deliver up the two flights of stairs to our flat. Our address quite clearly states we are a flat and at no point was this queried before delivery. We phone customer services to ask why this was never queried before delivery and we get told it's not their problem. We then contact them again to complain and get our refund we are told 'sorry you didn't read the T&C'.We did, they are incredibly vague on the subject. Simply stating if they don't think they can do it, they won't. Other companies asked ahead of time about stairs and adjusted their delivery to make sure they could get it to us. So we wrongly assumed Curry's would do the same.So we wasted almost half our day waiting for a delivery that was not only late, but couldn't even get brought up to us. Then had to deal with incredibly rude staff both on phone and online who deemed the whole situation our own fault, never once apologising for the late delivery and hiding behind their T&C to save themselves from the blame of not being able to complete the delivery.

Next day, I made a special trip to the store to collect the laptop after receiving the confirmation email to say it has been reserved and was ready to collect. I got to the store and was handed over to a member of staff who said they had to get it from the warehouse and this may take some time. I waited and the staff member returned saying that they didn’t actually have it in the warehouse, they could only offer me the display copy or I could choose another laptop. I opted for the display copy as the other options did not fit my budget or specifications. I was told to wait for the manager to come and help me. The manager never appeared. After waiting and waiting, the staff member returned to tell me that they couldn’t even sell me the display copy and when checking their stock, didn’t even have many of the alternative options he had initially suggested. I was told to wait a few weeks and try again but there was no guarantee any future reserved order wouldn’t result in the same disappointment. It is completely unacceptable that they can tell me a product is reserved and available for me to collect leading me to make the trip to the store only for me to find that isn’t the case. I wasted time and money getting to and from the store and more than half an hour waiting and being misled when they could have told me it just wasn’t available from the start. I don’t feel I can ever trust their online reservation system again. The staff member said themselves that it can be slow in updated, allowing several people to reserve one item and seems to count unsaleable display copies as stock.

I opened the plastic and tried on the headphones and thought the color was a bit too shiny so decided to return to the store within 30mins of purchasing the item. Went to the till and asked if I could have an exchange for a black one. They told me you can't exchange or refund the headphones once the thin plastic cover around the box is broken unless it is faulty or damaged. I spoke to the manager and explained to him that I only purchased the item 30 minutes ago and if they could kindly exchange them for the black ones. I didn't get no where with the manager as they just told me once the thin plastic is opened you cannot get an exchange or a refund (even though he was looking at the headphones carefully taking them out the box/case and inspecting them perhaps deciding whether he could be kind enough to exchange them giving that it has only been 30 minutes of purchasing the item). A week ago I purchased the Samsung IconX earbuds from the Samsung store and broke their security seal and decided later to refund so that I can buy the bose, I had an easy refund without any problems despite breaking a proper security seal on the box (like the security seals on phone boxes) in comparison to the thin plastic around the bose casing (like the plastic that are wrapped around Playstion 4 game covers). I even explained to them that the headphones cost £300 where is the customer service if even after 30 minutes you can't do an exchange just for simply breaking the thin plastic wrapper around the bose packaging box. I think anyone purchasing any items regardless of how much from £50 - £1000 should be extremely careful of PC World's customer service and I would recommend anyone purchasing any headphones to buy from either amazon or other retail stores that have perhaps some customer awareness.",2018-08-17

2321,5b757f5714b7d80958f91a03,"I bought this SAMSUNG QuickDrive WW80M645OPW Smart 8 kg 1400 Spin Washing Machine - White from Cambridge Newmarket road branch. We bought the smart machine and so, bought the installation service where the installation engineer can seat down with us and educate us on how to connect App with the device and take out the maximum benefit of the device. Curry’s charge 20 pounds extra for this service. We wanted to buy the normal one, but sales assistant, explained us the benefit of paying extra 15 or 20 pounds. We were convinced and opted for it, because we wanted to make sure that we can learn it through expert.Visit 1: Installation engineer told us clearly that he doesn’t know how to connect Machine with the App. we were quite disappointed, but we didn't bother too much. we went to the store and explained and they told that they will re-arrange the visit. Note: At the end of visit 1 machine was leaking some water as wellVisit 2: Engineer came and told us again that he doesn’t know how to connect Machine with the App. He was unble to resolve the leaking water issue and told us to see the plumber. While he was doing his job, he found that previous engineers had made some big scratch on the side of the machine, and told us to inform the customer service to request for the replacement device. We were disappointed. We went to the store and informed them about the scratch and incapability of engineer on connecting smart device with the App. Customer service told us that we will send out the new machine with the new engineer. By this time, two weeks time was over…so we were expecting at 3rd visit new machine with capable engineer…Visit 3: Engineer came and told us he doesn’t know but he can read the manual for us…he also didn't come up with replacement device...we were really disappointed….And also we checked our water leaking issue with plumber and he said the Currys guys did not install the washing machine properley. So it cause us extra quide for there unskilled engineer who install incorrectly.At every visit, engineer told us that we should report customer service, and customer service told that we will re-arrange the engineer.I hope you understand how valuable time is, mainly when you move to a new house, and struggling with the time.We had literally decided never to buy anything from Currys' but we had some good past experience with currys...so I kindly went to the Curry Cambridge store for 4th time, 30th July 2018. Explained the entire issue to store manager. I was expecting some sort of apology from the store...rather than apologizing Store Manager, blasted on me and told me that you should have resolved it within two weeks and very rudely told me that its not her fault, she can't do anything about it. So Delivery guys and engineer was blaming on Currys & Currys peope was blaming on installing guys. We, as a customer expecting at least some kind/constructive feedback on it to resolve the issue.Very poor custmor service.!!In future i will rather buy big electronics items from John Lewis. In past we had a problem with our mac book and john Lewis instantly change the macbook with new one. So i request you all to buy from any other store than 'CURRYS PC WORLD'.",2018-08-16

This is a massive shame as the replacement of our TV under warranty went smother than any other experience with a warranty I've ever had.Now, as for this delivery fiasco. I just started a new job so I can't take a day off work, my wife took the afternoon off work for our PAID scheduled delivery of our new tv. No phone call, no contact. When she tried to phone, she was rudely told they can only speak to me... her phone number is listed on the order form. Fine. I phoned Team Know How (ironic) and spent 20 mins on the phone before I was given minimal feedback from the first lady that ""no one responded to the buzzer."" OK, well she was in all day, so why didn't you call? ""They said their phone network is down"". Right, well this is 2018, phone networks do not affect singularly a depot and delivery drivers. It sounds to me like they just didn't bother attempting/ran out of time and put that in their notes.Got put through to someone on the delivery team which told me all the same info. Said they were confused about the address (which I had already confirmed as part of the ID process) and tried to blame it on the confusing notes in the account... I watched the guy in store enter my address and entry instructions, so another lie. I was then told that my delivery was rescheduled for Saturday, well we are away on Saturday, not that anyone bothered to notify us until I phoned. Got it changed to the first time slot of this morning 7-11 with an advisory note saying make it the first delivery of the day.I'm leaving for work in 45 mins and as the wife can't afford another wasted day off (where the same may happen), if its not here before 8:30 I will be taking action, be it legal or otherwise for a full refund and compensation for the afternoon she took off work plus the TV.",2018-08-16

2330,5b74655014b7d80940a3fcec,"Another customer let down by the farce of the Limited Edition PS4. How can a company get this so wrong? Currys must know how many items are in stock and be fully aware the demand for this will be high, so why are they over selling it? And why only let customers know by way of a 'your request to cancel your order has been successful' email over 24 hours later, giving people zero chance to obtain it from another retailer? How about a 'sorry, we are incompetent' email instead?And to not be refunding customers immediately is disgusting. I don't care that it is your policy to only refund within 3-5 working days. It is my policy that if I pay for an item as advertised, I receive it or get my money back immediately. Ringing customer services was completely pointless. All you get is a 'sorry, what do you want us to do about it' response. Here's an idea, how about you give me my money back and not take 3-5 days to do it? It's 2018, bank transactions are pretty much instantaneous. And fix your online ordering system too so that it can detect stock levels.Re response from Currys:Absolute rubbish.

Wanted to leave the cooker and someone would come and install it at a later date (when). Don't have room for that so the best they can do is deliver and install on Friday so need to take another day off work at my cost.Phoned customer services who basically told me that they don't compensate customers for the mistakes that their staff make.Poor performance by Curry's as we were told a pack of lies by one of their staff in their Ayr branch and only purchased at the Kilmarnock branch when we went to see the cooker as the salesperson there (Louise) had been extremely helpful.Will be a long time before I go back to Curry's.,2018-08-15

A fix for a machine less than 2 weeks old is absurd and consumer rights allows for me to arrange a replacement.I was presented with options to have my laptop picked up, Currys inspect and then when they next have the item in stock, send a replacement. This was impractical because my job depends on me having a computer. Another option was to take it into store, but there was no stock across the whole country.To be fair they did suggest a refund, however as I explained to the lady on the call, I purchased using a salary sacrifice scheme which would only provide Currys Vouchers through the refund and if they didn't have the replacement laptop available that would clearly be no good to me unless I was willing to wait for the replacement to arrive in stock.I suggested contacting their supplier to source a replacement. Apparently they are not able to contact their suppliers. I suggested that the local branch contact me when it is next in stock, but I am told that they are unable to contact their branches to arrange this.I kept trying to propose solutions, but because they did not fit in their narrow range of standard fit options, they seemed baffled by the idea of an alternative, practical solution to the problem.",2018-08-14

It was mid Monday morning and wasn't at all busy, there were more staff members than customers in the shop. After looking at the TVs for over half an hour with no attempt to help from any staff member I gave up and walked out. We went to the diy shop next door and my wife pursueded me to go back in and try again, as we needs a TV. 2nd big mistake! Another 20 minuets of standing around waiting for some help, at which point I went up to a group of about 7 or 8 staff standing together chatting and laughing. I asked if there was any chance of getting served today as I want to buy a TV. Silence! One then said, "" you need some one from the TV dept innit"" and shouted at the other group of four that were standing around chatting.. At last we're getting some where I thought. 3rd mistake. Guy was a complete idiot who spoke like a wanna be gangster and knew absolutely nothing about television. So we chose the set we wanted and just said ""can we have one of those please"" 4th mistake! After taking the number snd checking the system ""we ain't got none in stock, have to order it"". So I picked an alternative set, and after a big sigh and the rigmerole of taking the number, then back to the computer to check ""not got any of them either"" after a couple more checks and ""ain't got any"" I gave up. I asked what have you got in stock, he replied ""I can't check what just have in stock, you have to pick one; then I can check""! So I asked; can you check other branches for stock, he said ""yes they are out of stock too."" At this point I gave up, thanked him and left the store. What a useless shop.

Bought a fridge, arranged delivery, old unit removal and switching of the door direction. What could possibly go wrong....First delivery driver rang to say he was going to reschedule delivery. later said he could deliver but not remove old unit or change the door. Fridge arrived (late) and was duly bashed into a radiator en route. driver then explained that he had no orders to take away old unit or reverse door (Currys later said this was not true) Two days later, (after I had already put my kitchen fitters on hold - paid for of course), two men turned up to reverse the door; they left it such that the fridge door would not close - all the wires were dangling out. I contacted the 'engineer' who did it but all I got was denial and verbal abuse. Currys knowhow and Customer service were absolutely no help whatsoever throughout with exceptions in that some employees seemed to 'want' to help, but clearly could not.Please note that when we rang them, they assured us they were rearranging things etc etc. When we rang back 15 minutes later, the operative stated that no such actions were being taken, or that any notes had been added to the case.Even the timing of the visits were at THEIR convenience. I had arranged a between 9 am and 1pm visit and had this confirmed FIVE times; they turned up at 8:20 PM. Too late to get anyone back to fix things and all phone lines closed.There is much more detail in this saga, all of which will drop on Currys doorstep sometime soon; it may well end up in the small claims court.I regret buying from Currys and will never spend another penny in their stores.

This was because we had some steps leading up to the front door of our Victorian house. These steps had actually been re-built so they are much shallower than the original ones but health & safety was mentioned. My husband was also told that the fridge/freezer would have to be unwrapped before being brought in & he was asked whether he'd be happy to receive it in a damaged state if it was banged on the doorway etc. Naturally he said ""No"" but he also explained that the firm ao.com had delivered the same size American fridge to the identical house next door which actually has steeper steps. The Curry's delivery team was not interested & just drove away, cancelling the order. We then decided to order an American fridge/freezer from ao.com & the whole experience was brilliant. There is a space on the online order form for the customer to write details of the access to the house, number of steps etc. & add any other message for the delivery team. The two Lithuanian gentlemen who turned up on the appointed day had kept us informed of the time they would arrive. It was incredibly hot, they were running 2 hours late through no fault of their own & there wasn't a parking space available directly outside our house. They parked across the street & one of them came to the door to check on the access situation. The pair then removed the fridge from all the packaging & took off the doors before carrying it very carefully inside. The doors were then replaced & all this was done in the most polite & friendly way. We mentioned our previous experience to one of the men & he guessed the name of the firm concerned before we said anything. He commented that the Knowhow delivery workers used by Currys are all trained to remove doors but can't usually be bothered.We are about to order a dual fuel range cooker for our new kitchen but guess what? We will not be buying it from Currys. Our family & friends will also be using ao.com for all their purchases.

2353,5b70fa4614b7d80940a32190,"Updated on 26/08/2018.I bought an HP desktop computer from Currys PC World in June, and in the time that I've had it it's been to the repair centre three times, and twice I had to wait an extra long time for it to come back because a part had to be ordered in.The noise from the cooling fan is pretty bad, and that's the reason why I had it in for repair recently.However, I spoke to someone on the phone who sussed out that because I have a gaming PC, it needs a lot of cooling to stay at a good temperature, and so the stock fan is going to be noisy all the time. What I need is what's commonly called an aftermarket fan (because its not included in the marketed product).Basically, if you want a quieter computer, best ask for that when you're buying, instead of hoping that the repair service can work a miracle.I've upgraded my review to four stars because apparently someone who works for their technical support team knows their stuff. :)",2018-08-26

2355,5b6ec03b14b7d80a609fe1e1,"We will never use Currys again after the last 4 days (original post cited “24 hours”, now updated). We ordered an expensive Samsung American-Style Fridge Freezer, with a delivery date of Friday 10th August and a delivery slot of 2:25-6:25pm. In line with Currys instructions, we removed the contents of our old American-Style Fridge Freezer and defrosted it, We stayed in, only to get a call around 4pm to say that the delivery was running very late because of a “breakdown”. While trying to understand what this meant, the caller put the phone down on me (deliberately, not a line issue). I rang Team KnowHow back and they were unaware of any “breakdown”. 6:25 came and went and, despite four further calls to Currys and two promises of a call from the delivery crew, we heard nothing and knew nothing. My wife and I had an important dinner date and we left very late for this, asking our son to stay in. We had a call from our son at 8:30pm, upset and saying that the crew had arrived - but claiming that they had no tools to remove the doors of either the old unit or the new one (how can this be, since this is precisely their job and door removal was called out, in writing, in our order?). I spoke to the driver, who was extremely rude and abrupt. He maintained that they had no tools. He said that he had no option but to leave the new unit in the hallway and that another crew would be out tomorrow to remove our old unit and move the new one to the kitchen. I did not agree, but my son was upset and somewhat afraid (the driver was aggressive and his language was disgusting, apparently). We returned from our dinner appointment past midnight to discover the new unit completely blocking our hallway. To our shock... it was the WRONG unit! It was an LG fridge freezer (whereas, we had ordered a Samsung). So, we currently have someone’s LG fridge blocking our hallway, our old unit unplugged and defrosted in our kitchen, along with the rotting contents. We have no refrigeration in our house, thanks to Currys. Desperate calls to Currys today have only resulted in a delivery slot for TOMORROW (not today?)... which we have zero faith will be honoured. We are beyond disgusted, we are stressed and our weekend has been ruined. We are in the middle of this farce still and need a solution NOW. I am furthermore seeking FULL compensation from Currys (never let them call it “a good-will gesture”, because this implies generous magnanimity on their behalf). I purchased these goods using vouchers from my company, Procter & Gamble, with whom we have an employee-reward scheme. As a Senior Manager within P&G, I will be recommending Monday that Currys be removed from this scheme. And, of course, all my friends and colleagues will be warned also to stay clear of this terrible company, with staff who lie and bully.Dr Paul MattsSunday 12th August, 8:31pm - The Currys nightmare continues and so I am adding events as they occur, blog-style. We were given a 1:00-4:59pm delivery slot this afternoon. By 4:30pm, no delivery. I rang Customer Service to wait 15min while the agent established that we were the final delivery of the day and... running late. We were assured that there was one delivery before us and that they would be straight round after this and would ring 30min before arrival. It has just gone half past eight and we have heard and seen nothing. NOTHING. I am typing this from Domino’s Pizza, because this is our third day without refrigeration (our old Fridge will now no longer fire up without tripping the ring circuit, after being defrosted - all explained to Customer Services). My wife and I feel abused - literally - by Currys. The LG unit continues to block our hallway - tomorrow noon, it will go in the street. I am not joking. This is the worst Customer Care I have a ever experienced in my life... and it is not over yet.Monday 13th August 8am - my wife received a text saying, ""Great News"", our Samsung Fridge Freezer would be delivered Sunday 19th August. I am actually laughing while typing this, it is so stupid. My wife was on the doorstep of Currys in Weybridge at 8:50am ready for opening and spent an hour with the Store Manager. I spent a further hour there later this morning. We were in direct contact with the Depot and did not receive a satisfactory answer to why there was no delivery last night - and not a single word. The initial story from the Depot was that there was ""no record"" of the delivery although, when we showed the text we had clearly stating the delivery time, and also mentioned the conversation with Customer Service, strangely our details were found - apparently there had been a ""break-down""... although no-one thought to tell us, the customers, who had been waiting all afternoon and evening. Unfortunately, I do not believe a word of it. I pointed out that, if the delivery actually had been out then the Samsung unit should be at the depot and could be delivered today, Monday 13th. We were told this was not possible and told that delivery will be made tomorrow... another day in for someone. We will see... we have expected twice now and let down appallingly. Tomorrow will be our fifth day without a refrigerator. Thank you to Currys Weybridge for helping us all they could.",2018-08-13

2360,5b6d671414b7d80b00d156ad,"This is a copy of my last email to them:Case n. CC 3742119I have been directly emailing and talking on the phone with Teamknow how customer service for a month now. I find all this situation very upsetting and completely unprofessional how people are dealing with it. Finally, after lots lots of emails and phone calls, last Friday someone agreed for a compensation for the damage to the kitchen floor in my property, but you are asking me to provide a pro-forma invoice or a paid invoice before refunding the damage. This will force me to pay upfront for sure the cost of vinyl floor (£204.80) that I originally purchased when the floor was installed by the contractor at the beginning of July, prior the damage, and forcing me as well to pay upfront the labour (£150) as the contractor won't accept to be paid by 28 days (as you stated, period of grace for the payment given by the pro-forma invoice that the contractor should issue to me). I find this utterly ridiculous as since the beginning : - I provided all the evidence (pictures) and invoices for the cost of the vinyl kitchen floor installed at the beginning of July, only one week before it was damage by the delivery man who installed the washing machine and push it really brutally under the counter up to tear the floor. - I notified the damage 10 minutes after the delivery men left. - As you requested, I provided also another written quotation from the floor fitter stating that to bring the floor to its original conditions it needs replacement as it is made by 1 whole sheet of material 4x5m, not made of tile or planks. Indeed, the quote for the damage quote shows the same amount £ 354.80 (£150 labour+ £204.80 material) that I paid at the beginning of July.As I have already said, to allow the floor fitter to replace the floor, I have to buy again the material from Carpet Online.co.uk and as a consequence pay upfront for it.As I have already said, I am an architect and I work with contractors all the time. They want to be paid straightaway after the job is completed. The contractor is not going to wait 28 days for Curry to transfer the refund to me. This is not realistic and put me in a very sticky situation...as I said...forcing me to pay upfront also the labour.You just said on the phone, some contractor would accept to wait 28 days for the payment....again... you are forcing me to go around to find another floor fitter that eventually would accept this absurd conditions. I am a very busy person...Do you think that I have time to waste? I have found already a contractor that I trust and does a very good job, he replaced the floor in my all house. Why do I have to go around finding someone else? Why are you putting all this stress on me and making the resolution of this situation so complicated???Moreover, more than one time I asked to talk with a manager that was supposed to call me last Friday and never did.I would have expected a more honest and professional behaviour from a company like this. I have always been a loyal customer, we are a young couple at the beginning of our life together. Do you think that this will be the last appliances or electronic devices that we will buy in our lifetime? Instead of settling this rightful claim in a simple way, as I am afraid to say..you are in the wrong as you caused damage to someone's private property, you prefer to build a very bad reputation and lose a client.

I contacted DPD and they said they cant track the item and told me to raise a search with Currys. Called Currys and spoke to an advisor(he was really helpful) who said they'll have to raise an investigation which would take 7-10 days to be investigated. I ordered this product for someone's birthday present and was hoping it get delivered in time as mentioned on Currys website. I'm really disappointed that I can't get the phone on time and the fact that I had to chase Currys and their supplier to track the item to be told I won't get the product until the investigation is completed.

2366,5b6c197f9d2def0964682c8d,"Disabled ladies tv returned damaged completely by Know nothing......sorry how and Currys PC World assist this scam. If I could give ZERO STARS then I most certainly would. I purchased a tv for £1,500 you would expect it to last longer than 18 months, I have never had an LG tv before only Sony the salesman told me LG use Sony Parts and is a better buy as you get a 5 year warranty. I'm severely disabled and mostly housebound, my tv means a lot to me as my family purchased it for me.I use it for my university studies too and a vertical line appeared on the screen. After trying for nearly a year for Currys to collect the tv they stated to me the tv had marks on and had liquid ingress. They did not check for any other fault, the specialists who collected a 55inch tv took my tv uncovered through wet trees, and arch ways that are bushes smaller than than 55inches. This without doubt caused the marks to the screen and obviously the liquid ingress. LG have confirmed and put in writing this would cause the damage, Knowhow will not even let me know the technicians qualifications as these are personal and confidential to him and no one else.Knowhow have turned up twice to return my damaged tv and the driver was even shouting and swearing at me then eventually put the phone down on me. I did not know they were attending and I have had to hire a tv and due to this I cannot store the LG tv this would block my access to my kitchen, toilet, bathroom and bedrooms so they do not even care if I die from my life threatening condition and this is great service and I'm supposed to be over joyed.I am not allowed to see the photos of the tv opened up, I'm just being told go elsewhere and get a second report completed but LG are stating its electrical as they can tell by the vertical lines. Avoid purchasing your tv from Currys Pc World no matter how great the offer is.The story gets far, far worse My tv was returned on Tuesday and was dented very, very badly and was in such an awful condition the drivers were nearly in tears with me. I have to say these drivers were lovely and helpful and Currys and Knowhow do not have a system in place its all up to the customer when this happens to chase up. Once again this serverly disabled customer who has a life threatening condition has to sort out this mess which is the last thing I need after being sworn at previously and spoken to in an aggressive manner with someone from know how stating they are coming to my home with out my consent. My tv is is now worthless and I'm treated like disabled silly scum who you can pull the wool over my eyes. Trading Standards are now investing and you just want to change the back of the tv what about any internal damage???? So if this tv sets my home alight and kills me and others as I live on a country park its acres and acres of wood land. Do not use screen cleaner as apparently even though Currys sell it its a danger to you your tv, far dangerous than 2 drivers taking my tv out completely uncovered in the rain and through trees, bush's and arch ways. My fault was liquid ingress they cannot state what liquid it was but are claiming because I cleaned the screen I have photos of my tv before it left no marks were on it so surely the rain and trees etc must of played a part as LG the manufacture have confirmed in writing its an electrical fault not liquid ingress so they want to charge me £400 for a new screen, which will not fix the issue, as its not covered by my 5 year warranty. I asked a Manager to re open the tv and check everything for a fault as thats a proper test and report and they would not do this.But to damage goods in the condition they were returned is a disgrace, I am so upset and in disbelief still.",2018-08-09

We had done some research and a repairman had advised us before coming to the store and we had an idea which washing machine we were thinking of buying but both ladies gave us their opinions on the one we wanted and said that the previous make we had bought was still one of the most reliable and most popular machines. They were able to give us all the information to compare between the different models. Me and my husband like to laugh and joke at stressful times and we felt like we had met family that day as the conversation and laughter flowed freely between us all. Why can't shopping be more like this everywhere?! Yes we did buy a washing machine and another item as well because they gave us their honest opinion and aren't reliant on commission.

Then last week the kettle broke and had to get it replaced!As you must understand I am very unhappy about all of this we have had nothing but trouble and it makes me never want to shop at Currys ever again, we spent a small fortune with you in January and 3 things have broke down and the customer service following these incidents have been appalling, so I want a decent amount of compensation from you or I will go to the OmbudsmenI hope to hear back from you very soon",2018-08-08

2381,5b6ab09b9d2def0a5483d777,"I purchased a laptop from Currys PC World which turned out to be faulty with screen bleed, I was advised by the stores technician that they couldn't see the problem and I should bring it back if it got worse. Once the problem was severely effecting the laptop I took it back only to be told it was past the 30 days money back guarantee and that they would send it off for repair. They sent it off for repair and it was fixed promptly but the laptop was lost in transit at there distribution hub.I've been waiting two weeks now with no laptop and no refund and every-time I call them they hide behind terms and conditions and use delay tactics to avoid replacing the laptop and refuse to give me a refund. I'm over £500 out of pocket with no resolution. I feel ripped off and now have to spend an additional £500+ to purchase a replacement myself while fighting Currys PC World to be accountable for their mistake.UPDATE: Since writing this review, Curry's have written off my lost laptop and offered me a voucher code to replace it. However, the store did not have a laptop of a similar spec within the price range of the code. At the managers discretion I was offered a laptop with the same spec that was higher than my voucher as a replacement.

However I just recently used them to fix a noisy fan in my laptop that was still under guarantee. After a week I received a voicemail telling me it would be estimated £35 fix because it was spillage damage. Now the thing is this, I am a trained PC technician and if it was not for the guarantee i would do this half hour repair myself and I know that this laptop has not had any spillage at all, and hypothetically speaking if you threw a cup of liquid over the fan it would not cause mechanical defect, however I digress. I refused to pay and received my laptop back a few days later. I then got in touch with HP direct and they were brilliant. So to cut the story short my laptop now purrs again and no evidence of spillage it was as I said component failure. I now advise people to go straight to the manufacturer for repairI think it's time for the watchdog to have a deep look into this company because it stinks of scam. very amature people this knownothing lot.to your reply. no point in emailing you.

I'm just a sole trader so don't bother to claim anything as a business expense but happy to go along with what PC world suggestedGuess What? The laptop has faulty display panel and Currys have informed me that they will not complete the repair as the machine was purchased for business use. So I have 2 Macbooks from the same shop and only one is covered by 2 year warranty because the tricksters at the store opened me a business account.

2403,5b65e26c9d2def0fc43444cb,I wish I’d checked this website before I ordered my oven. Order ref is CUR1854406204 and delivery ref 7426146622. We ordered an oven on 2/8 which offered free delivery and I even checked that this applied to my post code. When I came to place the order and also pay for installation I was then presented with a different set of delivery dates none of which were free. I queried this with the on line help?? chat and was told this was due to different people doing installation and I could only have this at a weekend ( one of the original free delivery days was a Sunday). There is no free delivery option if I also require installation in my area so this is a misleading offer which may even fall foul of trading standards. Still I bit the bullet and continued with the order paying £10 for my free delivery and sent an e mail to “customer services” which they have failed to even acknowledge. Waited in all day for my delivery which their system showed would be between 2 and 6 and I had a text to confirm this. I checked status at 5 and this had changed back to order in progress so I phoned the helpline. The telephonist said it looked like the engineer could not call today but the record showed that I had been advised. I received no such advice so promptly cancelled the order and was told I would get an e mail to confirm this but refund would be 2-5 days due to bank processing times. I pointed out I used to work for a bank and there was no such delay in the banking system so any delay is due to curry’s. I will never shop there again!Standard response to this feedback appears to be to get customers to contact curry’s so I have left my reference details so they can comment on here about my issues or contact me if they want any more info.

However I have NEVER, spoke to a customer the way I was spoken to today by Janine in customer service at Currys. My husband and I bought a fridge-freezer and partially paid via vouchers. We are moving so were told at time of purchasing (done online) that we could discuss delivery options with their team if the set delivery date (which would be confirmed shortly after) did not suit.Indeed that was the case and this morning we contacted the delivery team to change the delivery date to discover that our postcode for delivery on the order was incorrect, despite the fact that on our account details it is showing perfectly correctly. There was no option but to cancel the order and replace it but they could not replace it for us - due to data protections reasons that they couldn't fully explain.We then received the email with further instructions as promised. Well in order to be able to benefit from the voucher discounts again, we would now have to wait 3-5 day as they send them via post to replace the original! Price could go up, stock down!This is itself is shocking customer experience, their systems are not sync'd up to see that on our profile the delivery address is correct, they can't take the correct details on the phone, they can't put a new order through and they don't provide an immediate resolution or offer to honour the price if the delay is on their side!We called them again and I spoke to Janine, she was rude, did not fully listen, told me it was our fault for getting the wrong address into the order and when I told her I thought my experience of their customer service was appalling told me it was not (even though that is MY feedback so I know what I am experiencing) AND that I was not the customer and she would only speak to my husband as the order was on his name. Janine told me she had given me her name already three times when I asked her, might be true but it is NOT the way to talk to your customers.When speaking to my husband she told him that I mentioned that our delivery address was correct in our profile and that it was not true. Well I would like an apology from PC world for being called a liar, as it turns out later from her that she cannot access that information only what is on the order rather than our account details.This is a sad sad affair that Currys does not train their teams to be able to pacify their customers and that their internal processes are penalising the customer and not customer friendly at all and their resolution attempt are ridiculously inadequate at best.We are now sending a screenshot of the profile delivery address and they ""might"" be able to reinstate the original order.MJ",2018-08-04

Website was good, ordering and arranging delivery easy, took day off work and on day of delivery I received a text update with a delivery time slot. So far so good. I should have known better, it just didn't show up. Eventually phoned Team Knowhow (half an hour on hold) to be told driver never showed up for shift so delivery was rescheduled for next day. Explained I had, re their instructions, disconnected and defrosted my old appliance (I had paid for the collection and recycling service) and that my chilled goods were in a cooler with ice packs, basically told nothing we can do your fridge will be delivered tomorrow. Explained I could not be in that day due to plans that could not be canceled (funeral) again basically they didn't care.In the end I had to arrange for a friend to sit at my house to take delivery.

He has rung me to say they still don't know why it was not delivered to us on Wednesday but I now have a telephone number for the Manager of the store so I can ring him on Monday morning.

Don't process finance agreements correctly, then take you to court saying your refusing to pay for goods, when they haven't even contacted you over it, then when you contact them they claim they've sent letters... Which never seem to arrive. Don't take direct debits when their supposed to, and charge you late fees for it, When you open a complaint and dispute any of this, they block all accounts you have with them. Disgraceful company that just pass the blame onto others and can't answer questions when confronted about their wrong doings, last thing I was told when doing so was... I've nothing more to say on the matter, bit poor if you ask me.",2018-08-02

I went to the desk with my reference number and they new all about it and had checked that there was one in stock before.

The whole experience, apart from them being on time, was completely unprofessional; bordering on downright incompetent & rude. Firstly, after bringing the item into our property, we politely asked if it could be put in the kitchen. They obliged & as soon as this had been done, one of them (the much younger of the two) just left. Didn't offer to unpack it at all. The remaining guy, who was quite a bit older, asked my partner to sign for the delivery (didn't offer to unpack the item) and then proceeded to ask us if he could use our toilet on his way out. We weren't asked, at any point, whether or not we were happy with the service provided. I have a serious mobility problem which requires the use of a mobility aid. This means that we were left without any help to unpack the item. They were clearly aware of this but couldn't of cared less. Their whole demeanor was lackluster. Didn't mind staying behind to use the bog though. Failed to provide the minimum service we paid for but were happy to use our utilities. I will be pursuing this further.",2018-08-01

2428,5b615f389d2def0fc432c628,I usually stay away from big companies for electricals.But i knew nothing about fridge freezers.I had limited options as needed a product to fit the dimensions of a cupboard in my kitchen.I saw one on google search at currys pc world LOGIK LFC50W18. I thought was simple case of they come put old fridge in take new one out and off i go.Wrong!! Delivery men to change the door over laid the product on the floor.I knew this was wrong.You arent supposed to lay a fridge freezer down! They proceeded to then damage the kitchen floor by dragging the new fridge across the lino.The old one they took away on wheels but strangely the new one didnt think to do so.They then departed and told us have to wait 6 hours before plugging it in..6 hours later i plugged in the fridge but didnt work.In fact the freezer was blowing hot air out non stop from the fan.I kind of had a feeling it was due to the delivery men lying the product down was the reason it didnt work!!After several phone calls was told would come and repair it on the following wednesday.I explained i dont want repair want a replacement.The replacement was arranged for the following monday.When this time the delivery men came and i asked them about lying down a fridge they said of course you never lay a fridge down! They knew what they were doing and propped it up against the back of the van at a slight angle to change the door over which is what the original delivery men should have done!The fridge is now working fine and the people i dealt with at the customer service on the phone have been actually quite friendly and good.But this experience has cost me alot of extra money.I bought at least 30£ of shopping the day after the fridge was plugged in and all that has gone mouldy so had to throw away.Also the floor damaged.I have been in touch about the floor and property damages are dealing with it.So far not sure if currys will pay out for the food which they should especially when its the incompetence of their delivery men which caused this.Overall this company has turned what should have been a relatively easy job into a total palava and put me off dealing or purchasing from them ever again.,2018-08-01
2429,5b60805f9d2def0fc432890b,"---------- Original Message ---------- From: - - To: Date: 31 July 2018 at 15:42 Subject: Currys refusing refund Hi Trading standardsCan you please advise me on how I should go about getting our money back fro Currys Weston for a faulty Samsung TV which my wife bought on her credit card for £1,129. They are only offering to change the TV for another and a credit note for any difference. They insist the only way I can get our money back is if I contact their head office. The email address they gave me is only their customer service address which don't reply to my query.We purchased the TV 3/2/18, and had constant issues with the TVPLUS app disappearing, after a day or so, resulting all the various apps, ITV hub,BBC hub, Netflix, Internet etc, all having to be reset each day. I contacted Currys ,who advised me to contact Samsung, and they reset the TV five times, each time telling me they were doing something different, even though I told them they were doing the same procedure each time. I took the TV back to Currys,9/5/18, and the manager instructed his staff to give me a refund or exchange, as what ever was my preference. I chose to have another the same, as apart from this issue it was a very good TV. The new TV arrived 10/5/18, and I set it up, all was ok for three days. I then went on holiday for two weeks,only to find TVPLUS again not working. Unfortunately I had a bad bout of the flu and my wife then got a severe bladder infection , so much so ,the doctor was concerned she might develop Sepsis. During this period several other defects started to happen. When we were both well enough, we returned to the store requesting our money back. They refused saying as it was over 30 days old, we would have to have it repaired. Eventually they agreed to contact their head office, and we waited a further five days to find out their head office insisted it be repaired. I left the TV with them 22/6/18, saying that according to Citizens advice website, they had one opportunity to repair it, and if not successful I was entitled to a full refund. I received the TV back 17/7/18, and it worked for only two days, I went back to the store, where the Service desk spoke to the manager who agreed to a refund. When I took the TV back the next day, a different assistant insisted I could only get an exchange, and if I wanted a refund I would have to contact their head office myself. I said I no longer wanted the TV and would leave it with them. She gave me a receipt for it, and said that if I didn't resolve the issue, or collect the TV within three months, the TV would be destroyed. They only respond to me when I put a review on Trustpilot, but only to ask me to contact them through email, and when I do this, I get no response, or if they do respond they ask for detail which I have already given them many times.Please advise on what I should do next.ThanksIan FletcherCurrys, please don't bother to respond, asking me to contact you via email, as you don't have the decency to reply to them.",2018-07-31
2430,5b604e1e9d2def0fc43270e0,"When I was ordering an HP printer online I was asked if I wanted to add extra printer cartridges for it. As it included a 25% (or something) discount I decided to hit enter and add it - I did not have to choose as they were the only cartridges on offer so I assumed they were the right ones for that printer. When the printer arrived it had ""starter inks"" so I put away the extra cartridges. It was only a few weeks later when the starter inks had run out that I took out the spare set - of course they didn't work because they were the WRONG ones. When I contact Currys PC World I was told yes they were the wrong ones but as I had already opened them they could not take them back. When I pointed out that it was their fault in the first place they would not accept responsibility so instead of a discount I was basically charged extra for cartridges which are unusable. Despite escalating it I was basically told to naff off. I will NEVER buy anything from this company again. Their customer service is NILL and their customer care policy is NON EXISTENT. Even if they have the best offer in the world I will never spend a penny more with them. And I will tell everyone about it too.",2018-07-31

I asked if his office would contact me that evening to arrange a further delivery date, he said they would. They didn’t!Instead I was called again by the delivery men who told me that delivery had been rearranged for Wednesday 1st, I asked them to get their office to call me back so I could arrange something more mutually acceptable. He said they would, they didn’t!Feeling somewhat suspicious with this one sided arrangement I rang the customer service number, they had no knowledge of a Wednesday delivery date and the earliest they could offer was Friday 3rd, which I reluctantly accepted.I will now wait and see if my dishwasher turns up on Friday.

2433,5b5f5b029d2def0fc4322fbc,I recently purchased a mobile phone from Currys then noticed the phone available at one of the listed competitors (ao.com) regarding price matching for £30 less so rang to request a refund of the difference as per their 'Price Promise' because it was within 7 days after my purchase. I was told that I couldn't claim because Currys hadn't got it in stock. Apparently for them to honour their promise the item needs to be available at BOTH companies when requesting the refund !!!I could understand if I hadn't yet bought it but I obviously bought it when it was in stock then found it for a lower price within 7 days. I have emailed Customer Services and if they decide to honour their Price Promise then i will delete this review,2018-07-30

The next morning I rang the call centre and they agreed that there had been a simple error but that the branch would have to put it right so they put me through. Then it all fell apart: The branch cannot correct a problem unless I go in because; 'I could be anyone' and when I queried this because I had all the reference numbers and receipts and had been cleared by the call centre I was told I had to come in and speak to a manager. He was abrupt and quite rude and quite frankly the customer service has not improved since my last problem. How I wish i had never given them a second opportunity! Thank heavens for the call centre who sent me a payment to cover the £20 which had been incorrectly charged without any issues.

So i knew it hadn’t been replaced & the stuff was still on it! So they lied, i have been really busy & also ill over the last 2 wks since i picked it up & haven’t had chance to check it more, so today the 29th july i thought i’ll go on my pc for a while, i turned it on & errors were on the screen, i pressed f1 & it took me to another screen where i didn’t know what i was doing, so i just had to turn the pc off by the button at the front, i turned it back on & it loaded correctly, that is when i noticed the hard drive had not been replaced as it would of said 1.81 tb available out of 1.81 tb, not 1.79 tb available out of 1.81 tb, saying exactly the same thing as it did before i took it in for repair so it is blatantly obvious they lied, and the faults & error what came up were exactly the same as it was before as that was 1 of the reasons i took it in for repair, the guy in the shop today said after me showing him photos of the screen saif it’s the motherboard, so for 1 knowhow should of fixed that problem but they didn’t even do that AND saying they replaced the hard drive when they didn’t, i also told them that the hdmi port wasn’t working, there was nothing on the paperwork about this so i said to them they haven’t mentioned the hdmi port to which they replied in store that they won’t mention it on the repair paper work unless they have replaced it & that it was probably just a loose connection & they would of repaired it, so more lies, the hdmi port still does’t work so even though that was reported to them as a fault they did ‘t do anything to that either! I have had to use a vga cable! So now i have had to take it back wasting my time again when i have a disabled partner to look after, the pc cost me £529 when i bought it & i have spent around another £500 to have it covered from knowhow, & all that money i have spent i just get lied to & no work has been done on it?! It is totally bot fair & i qm going to social media & trust pilot to let everyone know about this horrendous sevice i have had, i am not looking forward to the phone call for me to collect it as i have totally lost my trust in currys & knowhow now & it will more than likely not be fixed & i will probably get told a load of more lies now! Sorry if i seem rude as i know it’s not your fault who is reading this but i need to tell someone as it isn’t on, i want something doing about this, i am afraid i will just keep going through this with my pc & it will never be fixed!Get Outlook for iOS",2018-07-29

2444,5b5cb1049d2def09c82360d7,Hi On Saturday my grand daughter was going to currys in Ayr to pick her birthday gifts. She wanted a camera and Bluetooth speaker. So as we walk in the main door a guy comes up asks if we need help. We stated yes as we wanted a couple of items. So we picked the camera £139.99 Then the accessory kit at £25. Tripod £20 And Bluetooth speaker at £200. So all in a nice we sale. So we’re standing confirming everything and up walks a woman member of staff. Approach’s the guy serving us and says oh your wanted over here a customer has came back to buy there item and was your sale. She then turns to us and says il get Katie to deal with yourself. So at this I was taken back because I felt my sale was just as important as the other persons sale. I said to my daughter oh no come on we will go to another shop I’m not being treated like this. Now I didn’t say this to your staff I was talking to my own daughter Next thing your staff member starts following us out very loudly saying listen you want to hear me out. So I turned and said sorry no I don’t end of the day that guy approached us. Asked if we needed a little help. He was dealing fine with our sale now I’m sure the other person could of dealt with Katie or waited 5 mins At this she kept going on and on at us as we were leaving the store. Very loudly so that other people were staring. Twice I tried to explain no sorry I’m not spending that amount of money to treated like that. So we eventually got out the store away from her with her still in raised voice saying oh aye not letting me explain ? There was nothing to explain we were closing our sale you rudely interrupted took the member of staff away from us and on a sale over £400 by time insurance was added. So we then had to drive from Ayr to Kilmarnock to buy our items. Not what we intended as we live on Ayr. So it cost us petrol and time due to the ignorance of your staff member. I have proof of purchase for the named items above incase you think I’m not being honest. Will never purchase from Ayr store again and I’m disappointed & disgusted in the manner we have been treated. Yet your Kilmarnock staff. First class couldn’t do anymore to help us. Which is the way a customer should be treated. Yours Gillian Sent from my iPhone,2018-07-28

2448,5b5c63769d2def09c8234c6e,"Very poor service.Samsung TV purchased from Currys (PC World) Tunbridge Wells.I purchased a Samsung TV in November 2015.Model number Samsung UE50JU6400K from PC World @ £749. All fine until a problem this week. Nice TV and at the time of purchase price OK. This week the LED screen had a fatal error and the TV image is faded with split screen and major problems which cannot be corrected with a factory reset. It is not usable at all. Tuner and controls still work, along the LED array has a 'fatal' error. PC World & Samsung really unhelpful, primarily as I did not take out an extended warranty. At best, they wanted to charge me £95 to take away for review, and would confirm a conclusion in 28 days. In 2018, this is not acceptable. A TV (especially a 'premium' brand @£749) should last longer than this.Totally unacceptable. Beware, the after-sales experience has not been good. Is a TV that fails in less than 3 years fit for purpose? I am happy to return it to the store for a partial refund, however this is not possible. And the Currys PC World telephone number is generic so service as such.I have kindly asked Curry Knowhow to call me on a number provided, as you cannot get through to a person. Buy from PCWorld at your own risk.... kettle, small devices fine..... a TV that lasts 2.5 years...NO!Dr G Boxall.",2018-07-28
2449,5b5c57859d2def0a8ce12f3b,"Went in today to buy a fridge freezer with my mum, I have just moved in so my mum is helping me out buying me one. Lovely young man who had only been there 2 weeks started to help us out. Was going through the application when he asked a colleague called Mark what to do as he was unsure. Mark spoke to the young man in a very abrupt way and said you shouldn’t be doing this when you haven’t been trained. I understand that completely but the poor lad had only been there 2 weeks, you shouldn’t be letting people out on the floor who haven’t been trained in the first place. This was not his fault and it was embarrassing for the young man. He then said we will talk about this after right infront of me and my mum which again was degrading. Train your staff first before putting them out on the floor instead of it being their fault that they are doing their job and trying. Also the fact my mum cannot get the fridge delivered to my address because it’s ‘fraud’ when she had all her documents there and was there in person is ridiculous and I’ve never heard nothing like it, good experience with the young man but rubbish place.",2018-07-28

When they took it away the second cooker they brought was installed, used it that day and some of the rings on the top didn't work. After a lot of hassle their engineer came out and he said the cooker was faulty and for a cooker of that expense it wasn't acceptable so we should get them to exchange it. WHAT A NIGHTMARE IT BEGAN TO TURN INTO. They wouldn't come, were rude and awful at the silverlink store in North Tyneside. When they didn't eventually take it back, they refused to exchange it,.would not refund the installation and we also had to pay to have the cooker uninstalled.

Anyway we went over to the Laptops and after about five minutes had selected exactly what was required. I then tried to attract someones attention to no avail. So I made my way over to the Service Desk where a young lady sat trying to ignore me but eventually acknowledged my prescence. I told her that we wanted to buy a Laptop and had selected the one we wanted at which point she called over a reluctant Salesman.I repeated my request to him to which he replied...""Why do you want it?""Now I'm a reasonably calm person but by now I was at the point where I nearly replied "" To peel bloody Spuds, why do you think!"" However I remained reasonably calm and explained it was for my Granddaughter to use for College, to which he replied "" I would'nt buy it, they keep coming back, I'm just trying to be honest with you.

So now I'm waiting for a REAL plumber to come and fit my washing machine and stuck with another one that I no longer need! This is false advertisement Curry's!! You said you disconnect and install but you hire staff who seem to come up with ridiculous excuses as to why it cannot be done. Reading through the reviews it seems to be a common theme here.

2475,5b55ed2f9d2def09645f5ecd,"Upon my first visit to the Peterborough branch, I found an American Fridge Freezer which was an ex-display and on sale for a very attractive price. It seemed as though other than recommissioning and ordering a few parts this would be a seamless experience and only add to the 'more than satisfactory' customer service I had received previously at the Peterborough branch. Now, I must admit, there is a Sales Assistant at this store called Amna who has been the only person to continuously go above and beyond to help and the only person who provided exemplary Customer Service, whilst there were still very frustrating and trivial comeuppances I believe these were of no reflection to her and would go as far as to give her raving reviews. What made my experience bad ? 1) 6 weeks delivery time for what I was originally told by the sales person would be approximate 2-3 weeks. 2) Having to chase the store (by driving 6 miles each way) over 5 times to find out what was going on3) Told upon a visit I may as well just get a refund, because it doesn't look like they'll be able to recommission the item (3 weeks in) after just two moments before being told it had been recommissioned already4) THEN...finally, its ready ... or is it ? Delivery is booked and then Team Know How (or Don't Know How) decided to not collect my fridge freezer5) I had not been told, so in the afternoon of the day the item is scheduled to be delivered, I ring up Customer Services only to be told its not being delivered and there's NOTHING they can do other than reschedule it for another 3 days away (I had taken a day holiday to be available)6) I raise a customer complaint, and visit the store who received my complaint. One of the assistants rang the General Manager for me only to be told that the General Manager cannot get the fridge freezer delivered any sooner (even though its missed its slot, even though I'd been told by customer service that they promised they will get the GM to sort it out)7) Cooler is delivered - plug prongs are all bent, cant plug item in8) Cooler prongs are fixed and then the Ice machine doesn't work9) Get a new pump fitted, still doesn't work10) get told a new door will be ordered, then only to be rang and told there's nothing they can do about itToday is 23/07/2018 and I purchased my Samsung American Fridge Freezer on 01/06/2018, I am still waiting to have a fully working fridge freezer and again, even whilst on her holidays Amna is the only person who is willing to help sort out the ever evolving complications ...I understand the staff can only do what they're permitted to (which apparently is very little, apparently the case is the same for the GM as she could also not help me) so that leaves me to fault Curry's and their lack of customer support / care. The price may have been attractive, but the bad experience certainly paid for the discount. The only reason this gets any star ratings at all, is thanks to Amna.",2018-07-23
2476,5b54d0aa9d2def0b4c7ea61a,"Appliance was delivered damaged. Not a biggie because this sometimes happens and as the packaging was intact the delivery crew would have had no idea. The crew were brilliant and tried to sort the problem out, but this is where the issues began.Whoever they tried to speak to on the phone from their delivery depot was rude, unhelpful and just hung up on them. They rung again and were treated like they were an inconvenience.I was offered at first a 10% discount which on refusal was raised to a 20% discount, even though they had already been told that the damage was on the front, and too severe for me to keep it. They were eventually told they had to contact Samsung for an uplift number before Currys would consider replacing the appliance.Samsung wouldn't deal with the problem as apparently the telephone number they had for me wasn't the one I had given Currys. Well I'm sorry but I didn't make the transaction through Samsung so therefor it doesn't matter what details Samsung hold for me, although I have since checked my Samsung account, and telephoned their customer services to be told it is the correct number.The crew again tried to contact their depot who, before putting the phone down on them again, said without the uplift number they wouldn't/couldn't do anything. On my insistence the crew once again phoned the depot back and eventually a new delivery date was reluctantly given. The crew were doing an amazing job and none of this relates to the service they tried to give me. However if you are going to put people in positions that require them to deal with people in a polite and respectful way, you should at least ensure they are capable of doing it.I now have the replacement appliance, delivered in pristine condition by yet another amazing delivery crew.

2491,5b5093489d2def0f38cf2696,"There’s nowhere near enough charachters to explain every issue. I wanted to quickly buy a fridge freezer, I gave measurements and what I wanted to the sales guy. I picked the one I wanted but questioned the size and whether it would fit through the house. I was informed the installation team will remove the fridge freezer doors and it fits in ‘all houses’. I reiterated several times but he was insistent it would be fine. I asked to get a good deal if I get a washing machine too, he said sure. £2200 later next day delivery turns up and the installation guys say they can’t remove the doors as it invalidates warranty and you cannot return the item once tampered with. Complete lies. This was all happening whilst my wife was in labour and I had a relative wait in for that delivery. I called customer service whilst the washing machine was being installed to cancel the orders hit I didn’t get a phone call back till 6pm. I called the next day to see if they were just keeping my money and not refunding but I was told I had to go to store to get a refund- my wife is still in labour. Once baby was born I drove to store, the Romford store manager told me he doesn’t deal with customers, he’s above that job and was very rude and dismissive. I was then told I didn’t have to go to store and I’d have to wait another 2 days for delivery. I picked a different fridge freezer in which they didn’t include remova of the old one (I’d already paid for this). 2 days later my family are home the fridge freezer turns up and is so damaged the guys didn’t even take it off the back of the truck. They showed me, and I went back inside to call Currys for the 5th or 6th time now. They apologised and offered me £30 (less than 1.5%) of what I’d spent. I told them no, I JUST WANT A FRIDGE FREEZER THAT I HAVE PAID FOR! I then had to wait for another 2 days for another delivery, I had to arrange the delivery with the depot as apparently it was easier for me to do this than customer services. I have a 2 day old baby, a 2 year old and a tired wife in 30 degree heatwave and no cold food or drinks. 2 days later the fridge freezer turns up 8hours later than I was informed, this one was installed and as soon as the guys left, guess what??? THE FRIDGE IS DAMAGED!! It has dents all the way down the side. Again I called customer services, they offered me 10% off. They seem to think spending £800 after discount on a damaged fridge is fine. They then offered to replace the fridge, I don’t want anything to do with them, I am going to pay for Samsung to try and replace the side panel myself as I cannot deal with these people anymore. This all started from being completely mislead and lied to by the salesman in store (which is illegal) and I will be taking this as far as I possibly can to try and prevent them from doing this to other people.",2018-07-19

When you purchase something, your agreement is with the seller, not the manufacturer. Curry’s clearly don’t believe that and have washed their hands of the problem. The assistants at the helpdesk were truly not interested in helping and Curry’s policies don’t aid them either. As I said, appalling.

Took my 91 year old father into store in Erdington, West Midlands to purchase integral fridge as his had stopped working. Ordered, fairly good salesman and arranged delivery. He received telephone call at 5 pm day of delivery to say that driver would be fined 1K if he did not get back to depot and therefore could not fit fridge. Delivery was arranged for following day, nobody turned up. Went into store the following day, appalling service from the Manager, asked for a seat for my father was told there was not one available but he was offered a seat on a couple of display boxes !!!! Arranged a further delivery for the following Wednesday - the fridge turned up first thing TUESDAY morning, no telephone call and the delivery team managed to split his kitchen door. They left him with a telephone number to phone and left, leaving the old fridge which we had arranged would be removed outside. Phoned customer service again as I had already had 1 hr conversation with them when the initial delivery failed to materialise and I am now waiting for a call back from their damage repair team.

2507,5b4daabc9d2def0d54b075fa,"I've spent thousands in Currys over the years but no more.We wanted a Dyson fan and saw that this store had them after checking stock online, reserved the fan and then drove 14 miles to Preston. Told the shop staff that we had reserved the fan and they went off to get it, then a young woman came along who wasn't very smart looking and dressed more like a customer and started checking the computer but she appeared totally disinterested and didn't even look up at us. Various staff kept saying they were looking for the fans but couldn't find them. Another said they didn't know where they were in the store. There was four of them huddled around a PC and it was quite obvious we weren't going home with a fan. My wife said they were like headless chickens, they didn't have a clue. At least twenty minutes must have passed and we noticed they were messing around where there was a display item and attempting to box it up, so went over and told them I wanted a new fan in a sealed box. Someone then said he could order one for delivery tomorrow, I had to ask where the delivery would be and he said the store. No offer to deliver to our home, no apologies for our time and trouble.The staff cannot think for themselves and make decisions, did not offer to go and get the manager out to help resolve the problem but I doubt if he would be interested as the culture within the store is probably the same from the top. So we drove the 14 miles home extremely disappointed then went elsewhere and bought a fan with no hassle at all. Two hours, 28 miles driving just to experience nothing more than a farce of incompetence and inept customer service. Bye!Your reply says feedback allows you to continually improve your services.

No unknowing salesmen, just all the info I needed about what was included in the box, and loads of reviews to help me decide if it was any good.

I am very much tech savvy but I prefer to have buy such important things in store. I thought of asking someone else, but realised no was keen to listen.

It shows and confirms the level of service. it is totally absurd for me to copy my own review and post it to your email. If you are the authorised representative then you are welcome to copy the review and email it to the appropriate department rather than put up a show in the review page.A review in public forum is to highlight the standards of a business and quality of service. If I wanted to raise the complaint, I would have approached the manager of the hedge end centre, there is no need to write a review so I can be accommodated to complain.

2519,5b4b85b49d2def0af4676943,"Absolutely disgusting buying experience. Never again will I buy from Currys nor do I recommend anyone else. Bought a Samsung QE75Q&FN TV from them recently, £200 more expensive here as apparently they only price match a handful of retailers. Nonetheless I went ahead with them and paid extra only so that I could receive the TV on express delivery on a Sunday within a selected time frame 12.00-16.00 in time for a big BBQ we were hosting that evening. On the day of the delivery we were left embarrassed with an empty bracket on the living room wall (which was due to me having removed the old tv in anticipation for the one purchased from them) in front of 30+ guests. To our horror no delivery arrived in the selected time. At 4.15 I called Currys customer service to enquire and they informed me the driver came but nobody was in around 12.30-1pm. They lied!!! Not only did they not deliver but were found lying too! Fortunately for us and unfortunately for Currys we have a full hd camera enabled doorbell. This camera logs motion and doorbell rings and for that day log there was no activity during the delivery window. Subsequently the delivery and installation was rebooked for another date. The tv arrived on this second date but the delivery men refused to install as my wife asked for it to be wall mounted. I was not present then but left clear instructions for the team that the previous tv was of the same size and the bracket was already installed on the wall they just had to unwrap and mount the new one. They still refused and apparently got on the phone to book in the 'wall mount team' for the following Thursday. This team never arrived. I had to get a handyman and pay him £60 to do this. Both Marks Electrical and Crampton & Moore were offering a 5% discount off the original price of £3999.00 coming to £199.95. I should have gone with them. Their pathetic complaints/customer service team came back with an insensitive reply. This is after I shared documentary evidence with them of my front camera log proving that their company or delivery department at least(which is in-house and still their responsibility) to be lying! Instead of refunding me the price difference I paid only for faster delivery they showed complete apathy and offered a meager £30 voucher. Other companies are better equipped don't use these cowboys!!!",2018-07-15

This is what I did. Drove to my nearest Currys about 20 minutes away to he told as it was online I needed to ring. The store were very helpful and let me use their phone. The phone operator told me that he could ring them to see if they were still in the area but I was too far away from home. I was also told it would be a 'door stop' delivery.

2530,5b49bc899d2def052c62af1e,"I only gave 2 stars instead of none at all because there are one or two helpful people working for our local store.I took my Google Nexus tablet into the shop (Taunton) on June 13th as it had completely frozen and I have been paying into the care plan for a few years. To cut a very long story short, it took almost 5 weeks to get it back. I was told it could not be fixed and I had two encounters with a very young, rude, arrogant assistant who showed no respect whatsoever. I had a call from the technician asking me what was wrong with it - he hadn't been told! Eventually I received a call to say the tablet was ready for collection, and had been fixed after all. I had my doubts but the manager checked it before I took it home and it seems to be fine.So what's my gripe? The manager was quite helpful but that young lady needs some help with customer relations. I may be a pensioner but I feel I deserve respect. Not one smile, not one apology, and couldn't meet my eye when the tablet came back. I did mention it to the manager.The fault should have been found right at the start. It was returned to me the first time with exactly the same fault it had gone in with. The Currys team is all very friendly and helpful when they sell anything, I have spent hundreds in there over the years, but after sales is a joke. While I was there at one point I saw a gentleman with a vacuum cleaner that was faulty - and a different assistant was quite rude to him as well. I won't be going back there for anything.

2535,5b48a0d49d2def052c626c33,"Utterly disgusting experience. Not received product. Breach of contract. Caused immeasurable distress while very ill. Would give no stars. Had an order cancelled against my wishes and redone thus delaying my delivery all because I was misinformed on the phone about an aspect of the buy now pay later financial plan. Very annoying; I called Curry's initially while I was doing an order on the Internet for a fridge freezer to get some advice on the order process. When I came to the payment page I was going to use a credit card but then noticed the option to have credit for a pay nothing for 6 months option and pay no interest if it is all paid off by them or there would be a 19% interest finance plan to pay. The most important thing for me was to use credit card for payment so that I was covered by the Consumer Credit act for my purchase so I asked Jonathan whether it would be the case that if I took the ""pay nothing for 6 months plan"" if I could use a credit card to pay any amounts I wish as regular installments during the interest free 6 months so that I could pay it all off on 6 months and getting my consumer credit act protection while spreading the cost. He said yes you can indeed make payments to the finance company with a credit card and as often as you like to spread the cost. I asked if he was sure and if others asked about this. He assured me he was right. I asked him to double check but he just said he was correct. I said ok I'll do the order that way and I'll use my credit card every month to pay 6 installments to spread the cost and it will be paid off in full to avoid hefty interest charges. Delivery was for 2 days hence. I went into the Slough store to view the item on display the next day to double check I made a good choice and was happy with it. While there stuff offered to see if they could waive my recycle fee due to various other in store issues I was unhappy about before I eventually bought it online. I gave them the order number and said i took the credit plan and was told they don't accept credit cards for payments and I was given wrong information by curry's on the phone and the only way to fix this is to cancel the order and make a new one and pay for it in full with my credit card. So the second order was arranged for the day later. I told the store that I am being given inconvenienced by this delay and it is all curry's fault. I said they should raise the matter internally. Nadim the store manager told me later that he will raise this. He arranged new order which would arrived Friday now instead and he organised recycling. He also assured me that I will receive a hour's warning of arrival by phone to accommodate my disability needs. Thursday evening I received confirmation of a time slot which said 08.55 to 12.55. On Friday morning I defrosted my freezer and dried it out ready for recycling and of course all my freezer food was therefore removed. The fridge did not work at all anymore. I had just collected medicines which need to be refrigerated after a few hoursAt 8am I called curry's main number to ensure I will receive hour's advance notice of arrival. A woman called Emily called Aylesbury depot who assured her there and then they have told the drivers to call am hour ahead. By now I had already seen for myself one after the other Curry's delivery horror story and appalling review on Trust pilot and was now very nervous about anyone damaging my flooring or property or not removing packaging etc or placing it where it should go. I told Emily of my concerns about these reviews and she said she knows about those but there are many good deliveries. I hung up nervously. At 09.30 I received a call from a driver saying they are arriving in HALF an hour not an hour l. I said no, they were supposed to give me an hour advance notice. They said they were not told this. I said well I'm up now so you may as well come but they ended up not arriving till 10.30 anyway. As soon as they arrived one of them came in and I showed him the appliances for recycling. I said to be very careful not to drag anything on the floor. He looked totally at a loss as though I was asking something extraordinary. His English was obviously very poor as he didn't understand me very well when I said I am already worried about floor damage because he responded as though he didn't understand what I was getting at. I had to explain further to ask if they have methods of protecting the floor and he didn't have much to say. I bent down myself to unplug the appliances which were long switched off at the wall and already defrosted and dry. When I got up to my surprise the other man was be approaching my small bungalow with the new fridge freezer on his own. It was precariously balancing in the pavement as he let go . I said stop. Don't bring that in yet. You haven't taken the old ones out yet. I waned them to take their time to carefully lift out and remove these and make the space first of course and then was going to quickly brush away all the dort on that corner. I said you obviously can't being anything into this tight space yet before making room! The last thing I needed was then dumping a huge fridge freezer in my tight hallway where all my crockery shelves are etc. As soon as I pointed out the obvious ie. to do one thing at a time, the driver with the new item put it back in the van and refused to work anymore. He said he's ringing the depot. I said to the other mam tell him to do his job and hem you remove these recycling items then back with the new one. He just looked at me smugly and grinned and said he can't tell him to do anything if he's refusing! I said this is a breach of contract and they have a job to do. They both went into the van and for 25 minutes nothing was down while one of them was on the phone. I kept demanding that they get out of their van and do what they are there to do. I was totally disgusted. Before the first one had walked off in a huff I had said I have critical me if medicines that must be refrigerated asap. He rudely said go get medicine from somewhere yourself the also in very poor English. The other mam said he can't do anything if the other is on a bad mood. I told them I am recording this entire episode of shocking behaviour and I expect them to give my property. While watching them do nothing for 25 minutes I called curry's and after a very long delay and menu options a lady called Lairs answered. I told her what happened. I said I expect to receive my property right away. She put me on hold for a long time while contacting the depot in Aylesbury. To my shock she said the depot said there was an ""altercation' and driver refuses to work. I said that's incredible since the drivers are at fault and it was their refusal in the first place to accommodate wishes to not bring the new product in until removing the old ones which started this whole thing in the first place and I had every right to repeatedly insist that they get out of their van and do what they're supposed to do. She said I won't get it till next day. I said that is an unacceptable breach of contract and I will be expecting compensation for this. She rudely said no it's not and you want get compensation if you eventually receive it! I was so angry and hung up and drove straight to Curry's in Slough where I originally bought this hoping to speak to Nadim the store manager who did this order. I called ahead to say I urgently need to talk to him initially hoping I could do it by phone. A store person said he's on the phone and will call me back straight after. At that point I decided to go straight there. When I arrived soon after 11 I was told he'd left for the day! I said but I was just old he would call back when I said it was an emergency. Instead, I sat down with a duty manager called Peter who was actually very helpful and he did want to sort things out. He told me he totally agrees with that this should not have happened and he did not actually know what he would be able to think of to say had he been the customer in an unacceptable situation where he found himself having drivers inapprpropriately refuse to do their job havomg to insist they do and then being left without his new fridge watching them driving off with it.told I am ill and that I even told the appallingly behaved drivers that I suffer with anxiety so they need to accomodate that at my pace and not cause me stress. I told peter there was clearlya language barrier as well as an attitude problem with them. Peter got the aylsebury depot to arrange for other drivers to come with another new machine but it is in Milton Keynes which is miles from me so it will be delayed to at leaat 3pm and maybe 5pm. I said by then my freezer food will be totally ruined so i will expect compensation for that as well as my journey to currys today on top of a considerablea amount for my distress unconvenience and now in fact a 3rd delivery and huge delays. I said that to drive off with property which now belongs to me is basically hijacking my goods. I consider this theft by the drivers. Peter told me to mention his name in complaint as he's happy to attest to what I said and i also asked that he independently express his thougts about what I atrocioulsy suffered today and let customer servcies know I will writing in. I said I do not trust your complaint process after the shockimg way I was treated and the utter dismissiveness of Laura. I said quite frankly I feel I should receive compensation which equates to the amount I paid for this product. He said I should state this in my complaint letter. I told him that I an very unwell and this is the last thing I need and I had plans this afternoon which are now ruined. He said anyone should expect their wishes in their home to be respected and he'd have been angry too and it does not reflect the pride he has with how he works but many bad stories are the norm I said. I now await delivery and hope my nightmare ends.",2018-07-13

2537,5b488f709d2def0af466cb72,"Terrible experience:Visited your silverlink store a few months ago to purchase a TV. I had my eye on a 40inch Samsung and entered the store with the intention to buy. I was approached by a member of staff who started friendly, but then decided it was appropriate to tell me the TV i was looking at was ""no good"" and that i needed to look at a Sony bravia that was hundreds of pounds more expensive. When i asked why, his response was that the Samsung was actually a cheap JVC in disguise. Fair enough, I thought, afterall he is the expert, though i did leave the store empty handed and feeling a little bit silly and cheap for wanting the samsung tv (not to mention confused that a shop would stock products that were deemed by their very sales staff as being ""no good"".)A few months pass and I revisit the same store for a new vacuum cleaner. I had in mind a Hoover cordless, not the cheapest nor the most expensive, but a half decent option nevertheless. I was approached by a different member of staff who immediately pointed out that it was (exact quote) ""no good"" and directed me over to the Dyson range. Once again a feeling of being financially inadequate washed over me as i looked at a price that was triple what i was previously looking at. When i asked why i should justify spending hundreds more on a hoover the assistant started to list from the box the features of the dyson. I can read too, this doesnt make me an expert on vacuum cleaners. When i said it was over my budget then she directed me back to the ""no good"" hoover option. This confused me, as seconds earlier it was inadequate. When i asked her why its now a good option for me she said ""well ive just saved you a couple of hundred pound"". A short while after i accompanied my parents to look at a new TV. I was slightly reluctant based on my last two experiences but agreed to go with them to help choose an appropriate option, and also, to make sure they werent pressured into upgrading their option to one that is unrealisticlly expensive. They found something that looked great and asked a member of staff nearby to help them sort out how payments would work (while I hung around nearby) and were, within 20 seconds, told that the tv in question was ""no good"" and that they shouldnt waste their money on this inferior product. They left empty handed and with feelings of inadequacy (I know this feeling).I have worked in a sales job now for 12 years. I know all about upselling, I know all about selling the features and benefits of products beyond clients reach, I know all about not assuming what the client wants is final. However your sales staff absolutely stink of sales-desperation. They dig themselves into holes by falsely undervaluing their own products to justify ""upselling"" to ones they want us to buy. Your staff know NOTHING about what they are selling. They utilise pressurised sales tactics to get what THEY want, not what the client wants. This drives us away, we don't want people making us feel cheap, silly and poor for wanting a particular product. Why are your staff doing this? Sure, advise people that there are better products available, but dont de-value the product they are interested in. Your training for the job must be terrible - it smacks of ""get them on the sales floor, selling - now"". i dont feel valued or ""put first"". Horrible experience and im done with visiting your stores.",2018-07-13

2545,5b45ed6a9d2def0af465fd52,"I have a Hoover washing machine purchased in January this year including a care plan. I contacted the Currys help desk when my washing machine flooded my utility room floor to inform them and to arrange for a repair. An appointment was made for three days later which was inconvenient however I had to accept that this was as quickly as it could be done. I also noted and informed them that the fault was an inferior retaining ring fitted to the door seal as a cost-saving exercise to reduce the time during the manufacturing process. I purchased an item from Currys with an inherent fault and i asked them to take it up with Hoover. I had to explain to the representative that it is their responsibility to ensure that the product that I had purchased from Currys was fit for purpose and it was also their responsibility to take this up with Hoover not mine. My contract was with Currys not Hoover. Looking online I am not the first and will certainly not be the last person with this issue and therefore wished to register this as a complaint. The customer services chap at Currys called Akash informed me that this would be an internal matter and that I as a customer would not receive any response about my complaint. I found this unacceptable. I subsequently raised a complaint about the complaints procedure that the complainant would not be informed of the outcome of any complaint! I again asked Akash if I would receive any response from Currys about this complaint and was told clearly that I would not. The complaint about the seal number is CC3735259 and the complaint about the complaints procedure is CC3735261.My understanding of customer service is obviously a little strange. As a complainant, I feel it is quite reasonable to expect a response from the company I am complaining too! Akash seemed to feel that this was an unreasonable expectation. I feel therefore that Curry's customer service is nothing short of a joke. Rant over.The engineer called this morning and did an excellent job. He was polite, helpful, efficient and prompted me to have a few minor issues with my tumble drier dealt with while on site as he knew I have a care plan on this item as well. Excellent service!!!He agreed without any prompting from me that the retaining loop was not fit for purpose and fitted to save money. He, therefore, fitted a new retaining ring that actually does what it is supposed to do which is to retain the door seal in its seating in the washing machine drum. The faulty retaining ring relies on a spring to hold it in place where the tried and tested ring is tightened with a screw! I suspect that fitting the inferior ring saved a maximum of 30 seconds which would be the time required to tighten a screw. I spent an hour on the telephone to customer service, they had to arrange a visit from an engineer who then took time to fit the correct ring. What cost saving and customer product satisfaction was achieved by this cost-cutting exercise? I reiterate that the product I was sold was not fit for the purpose when it was sold. If the same spring had been refitted it would have retained the inherent fault and I would have demanded a refund!I would welcome a response from Currys, however, I am not holding my breath as apparently responding to a complaint is not part of their remit?One word describes this attitude. Ridiculous!!!Kindest regardsDavid HusseyUpdate-Please read the response to my review from Matt at Currys. Part of dealing with a complaint is to understand, take ownership of the issue and respond to the complainant. The response from Matt does not answer the real issue which is that the complaints referred to the inherent fault with the manufacture of the machine and about Curry's idea of customer service. Neither of the issues have been responded too or dealt with in any way! Somehow this does not surprise me. Pathetic!!!.",2018-07-12

Anyway oven fitter did arrive and fitted oven but found no potstands with oven so can’t use hob, promised by fitter he would check and call us if had them in and also suggested go to local Curry’s and ask them, which I did as no call came back from fitter. Kind customer service lady at Curry’s ended up ringing Smeg up to send potstands and they arrived a couple of days later on the 5th. Finance dept rang today (9th) to send £50 payment but said we wouldn’t accept due to further delays, they then dumped us through to Team Know how, who basically was a bit short at first as thought we had rung through again about something that had been resolved so had to talk through whole journey and they offered £70 and basically told me if wanted more than that then would have to restart the whole complaint again and unlikely to get the £100 I asked for, which felt was reasonable given time we had been without cooker. I asked to speak to manager and was told they would not agree any more money and they would have to call me back in 3-5 days maybe. I felt bullied into taking the £70 and really don’t want to use Curry’s again as they use Team Know How and they are not very pleasant to deal with.",2018-07-09

2556,5b4333a36d33bc0e8416b08f,"I went in to a nearby store yesterday with the intention/need to buy a new PC that day, with a ballpark figure in mind that I wanted to pay. A very polite and helpful person was on hand to help, and did very well, engaging in conversation and helping make a decision on a machine.I made a decision that either of two computers would be suitable but conveniently for Currys both were out of stock, which meant I ended up purchasing the last and most expensive choice. I then said to the salesman I wished to purchase this PC as well, and thanked him for his help. After this a second person came along, who turned out to be a supervisor. This person was no help at all and, in fact, made me listen to the exact same spiel all over again. I stated I had made a decision based on experience and that I wanted to upgrade the PC over time, something that is possible.After the Supervisor went away (after around 20-30 minutes), I was then made to listen to a third salesman’s talk: this time though he tried to blag his way into the same chat yet again by opening the PC and showing me the internals, something I am very familiar with. To my astonishment he then began to tell me that it is barely possible to upgrade a computer bought from PC World, and that I should just look online to buy components and build one myself. He then began slating the machine I wanted to purchase, saying that its components were no good and that his older components in his own personal computer were even better than what I would find in the PC I had chosen!After listening to even more drivel about how it wouldn’t play the games I wanted to, AND that the machine would perform badly, I then had to sit through the final phase of the three-man battle. The third salesman then finally asked me to complete a Direct Debit Mandate for PC Support, something which I especially wouldn’t need. I stated clearly I would not need it and explained that I would be fine without it. He pushed again, telling me that I just need to set it up and then cancel it; I said “no” for the second time. Finally he literally said the same thing again, but this time almost tried to usher me over to his till to set up the Direct Debit. I declined a third time and, after 45 minutes, finally got to buy my computer.But wait... to my dread, the first man then had to take me through five minutes of a leaflet that detailed Support... AGAIN!50 minutes in and I was able to leave the crucible after defeating all three salesmen and their tactics. Time is money and - after almost an hour - I felt robbed!Shocking, inappropriate and shameful service! In short, I won’t be coming back again.",2018-07-09

They said it was because they weren't insured. When I later checked the website it says that it is at the delivery team's discretion on arrival. So they lied.

Not only that the delivery came exactly the day that I said I could do it, after they had me pay for it but the TV was faulty, the customer assisaint convinced me to pay insurance for it and when I took it back only to be told she hasn't selected that option. Took the faulty item back I had to wait 2 weeks to be seen and nobody would ce back toe about it. Rang the store like millions of times and nobody came with a straight answer. I went to currys again to ask about it and been told that there's nothing they can do and I have to take it by myself to an authorised Samsung repair service. Bare in mind that this was a 49' TV and I am a tiny person.... They wouldn't even help me carry it to my car. The bil for the service would have cost another 450 pounds for a new screen, after paying around 600 for the new TV. Now could someone tell me why do they sell stuff they can't repair and why did I have to go through this as a customer? Everything is fine until something is faulty and you have to go back to fix it... Their service consist in selling stuff and that's about it. I will never in my life again buy from currys...

Feel totally let down hight lighted the fact this is a misrepensentation asked for a full refund was declined.

Didn't even ask if that was ok and that that was what was going to happen. A big company that drives small companies out of business then having a monopoly treat there customers terribly. If it was only me I'd have let it go but almost everybody I talk to says they have an issue. I told them I didn't want the cooker, no apology. I did find a local company that they haven't destroyed yet, ordered delivered and fitted within four hours, see Currys, it can be doneWhen I asked the manager for a name and number of his regional manager his exact reply was ""I can give you that but it won't do any good"" That seems to sum up their whole rotten attitude. Bridgwater Branch are one to stay away from, same as the rest of them really. Over the last 4 or 5 years I have spent over £5000 with them, not another penny is going their way. I'd rather use Argos and if it costs a bit more it's a price well worth paying!!In response to Rich D from Currys comment, it would appear, by reading the many reviews on trustpilot it would appear you are not hitting that level you of service you are striving for with the majority of reviews being negative.As this review was so negative and written in anger, I have had time to reflect on my approach, the fact that the experience was efing awful from start to finish still stand. So as it was aimed mainly at the Bridgwater store, I have decided to try Currys online, because I don't want my money going through that store making the figures up for particularly bad management. Yesterday (28/818) I ordered a 50 inch 4k Samsung tv and Xbox one x for next day delivery for an £11 delivery charge. It is now 11:15, let's see how they do, who knows, I might even be able to recommend their online. The story so far, ordering was relatively easy and I have had an email to say my order is with my local DPD ( oh, s**t, that could be the killer) branch. Results will be posted! Of course after my review Currys won't my future business but just for clarity the products were the same price in Argos and I could have collected same day but I wasn't in too much of a rush.So TV was delivered at 11ish, by know how. The Xbox games and Xbox live were delivered at 1:20pm, a quick call to customer service, a helpful chap, he rang me back and said Xbox will be delivered in up to 50minutes, still on target, but losing a point for 3 deliveries on 3 different vehicles think about the environment please! Well done Currys, you've done it again 2 items arrived, the other one that I paid next day delivery for won't be with me until tomorrow, a day wasted staying in, how difficult can it be? Somebody there please explain to me how a huge company cannot get one item out to a customer within 24 despite it being in stock and the order accepted. You really are in a class of your own aren't you, absolutely useless!!!A trip to trading standards tomorrow, if this isn't sorted out tonight. 3 phonecalls one that would be returned in 10 minutes hasn'tI rang back, I spoke to a customer service agent, the upshot is, fck you, we'll deliver it tomorrow. I then get an email, talking about MY request for the change of delivery date! Look in the dictionary you will find a request may suggest I have any choice in the matter. How many chances do you give these companies? I have spent £ooo's in their stores, but there it is proof if needed, online are equally as bad as instore. The last rep I spoke to said ""I can see on the system the Xbox was never loaded for delivery today"" Well that just about sums up how honest and interested this company are in giving good customer service, So here I am, blood pressure through the roof, stress levels through the roof, ready to crush a grape with my bare hands? It is 19;19 and the gentleman that delivered it spent 5 minutes in the back of his van for 2 packages, 0ne of which had been delivered this morning. It seems maybe it isn't only the customer they fck about.I would still like a response from Currys customer services to explain how all these errors can occur, it really is a shocking shopping experience",2018-08-29

Last week (29/05/1) I visited the strore to buy a dishwasher, spotted an ex-display model on offer, which I enquired about as it was the model I was already interested in. I eventually found someone willing to assist, more staff in store than shoppers but several had already claimed to be too busy (it was 18:00 on a Friday evening). The shop assistant was of no use whatsoever, all he wanted to do was sell me extra insurance and charge for a delivery, neither of which I was interested in, I was in a van ready to take home a dishwasher there an then! In the end I left the store and ordered online!Then yesterday (04/07/18), I went into store for a collection, time was around 16:00, and there was at least 3 times as many staff on the shop floor than customers, but no one on the collection point, and everyone was too busy, as far as I could see, doing nothing!!So I ended up browsing the store a while until someone appeared at the tills, during this time I spotted a Ring Camera on a managers clearance deal, was a huge saving and would go perfectly with the Ring Doorbell I was collecting. I approached the chap now on the tills and explained that I was there to make a collection and was also interested in the camera, he rummaged through a few cupboards, pulled out the Ring Camera and put it on the back shelf, then disappeared out the back of the store, cameback 5 mins later with nothing, rummaged about a bit more and produced a bag from behind the till which had my order in it. Then we got onto the camera, he was going to charge me full price (£169.99), I explained it was advertised on the shelf at £84.99, his response was that was out of stock instore and was being advertised so people could order it online. He insisted that the camera he'd got out was a different version, yet there was no other version on show instore, and I've since researched and there's no other Ring Camera versions!Not only did nothing he was saying not make any sense, his attitude and way he spoke to me was downright rude and obnoxious",2018-07-04

The eventually came out and fixed the problem, and I have a report to say that the gas leak was caused by there initial fitting as they had fitted the gas appliance incorrectly in the first place and again I have this in writing on an official report, curry's are now saying that they are not responsible for the obviously dangerous and poorly fitted items even though they fitted them in the first place! they also suggested that I pay for a third party to fix them personally.

2582,5b3b470a6d33bc0c94b0547f,"I bought a brand new Hotpoint washing machine and seperate dryer from Aintree in Liverpool, the washing machine knocked on fast spin, after the usual over the phone questions ""have you removed packing and transit bolts?"" yes. ""have you levelled the machine?"" yes. I was told they would send out a hotpoint engineer on Tuesday (this was Thursday) no problem as it still worked on lower spin speeds, later that day it failed completely so I call up again only to be told I'd have to wait till Tuesday for a hotpoint engineer to inspect it at my home, I explained I was allowed to return faulty goods as my contract was with the shop but was fobbed off. I later checked online and found that they do accept returns on faulty goods bought in store within 30 days, I called the Aintree store and the manager said he would accept a return, I replaced the transit bolts and headed back to store, now the sales staff start a conversation with Hotpoint who say they will send an engineer to the store on Tuesday! The store say they can't exchange before the engineer inspects it, hotpoint ask if I've removed the transit bolts? Yes but I've put them back in to return the machine to store, ""ah you can't do that as you will damage the machine sir"" they say now I point out that their instructions say the bolts must be reinserted during transit, now they just insist an engineer inspects it first. I explain to the curry's staff what it says about their 30 day exchange, they say it doesn't include white goods . . . I show them their own web site saying 'Inc white goods' and demand to see the manager, after a heated debate they eventually agree to give me another machine, this works fine. I will never ever buy from Curry's or Hotpoint again in my life, absolutely disgusting customer service from both and curry's ignore the law on exchanging goods, my contract is with you curry's not hotpoint so you, by law have to refund or exchange the goods.

2583,5b3ab0216d33bc0c94b03602,"Not sure where to start.First I visited the Maidstone Aylesford store I waited a long time before any of the staff came to me (incidentally they were doing nothing and chatting amongst themselves). I finally spoke to one person, wasn't really interested in selling me an oven and telling me its probably better to buy on line for a better deal. So I looked at the ovens that were there and checked the measurements which appeared to be ok or should I say hoped would be ok. I then left the store.I purchased an oven online, unfortunately I had a unique setup in relation to the rear of the fitted oven box, ie there was a gas pipe from the stove which restricted the choice I had in terms of ovens that would fit. It needed not a box shape at the back of the oven but more of a step down (my previous even had this).MMmm so I returned it asking for pickup. waited a a few days for pickup and then waited more days to be credited - arduous.I checked on line again and there were Strangely no images of any rear of the oven for me to look at. So I then chose to visit the first store again. I met with the same person again (yehhh!) and asked if I could peek behind the display ovens to see and confirm that the oven should be able to fit the measurements I had. The staff said she couldn't do this and that there were no staff to help - yeh, unhelpful again! There were 4 staff on the floor I counted... again doing nothing. I stated I needed to have a peek and said surely there have been other people with similar issues - she agreed this wasn't uncommon and on one occasion highlighted one guy had tried 7 times trying to get an oven to fit - she looked amused. She then told me it was probably better to go to another store ie a competitor to Currys - Staff are trained to recommend competitors uhhhh? So I picked another oven from the store and would be delivered a couple of days later. I felt I was a hindrance and undervalued!The second oven didn't fit - oh there is a surprise.So Im pretty annoyed as I haven't had an oven to cook with for 2 weeks. I drove into Maidstone Aylesford a third time with the oven in my car. This time I actually had some one to ask me if I needed help. I stated my problem (and the unhelpful ness of the staff) and he told me there was no problem viewing the oven from the rear and showed me the ovens I was interested in. It talk him approx 3 seconds to open a metal slat at the top of the display - it was a miracle I could see the rear of the ovens! So I could now definitively know which oven I could go for - the guy said its now rare to have anything other than square box rears to ovens and that this was the first time in 2 years he had seen an oven with a ""step"" affect at the rear.So there was no stock at Maidstone Ayelsford , had my refund (again takes days to come through). The guy then phoned sittingbourne and reserved the oven required.I Drove to Sittingbourne, 6 staff roaming around doing nothing and I had to ask for assistance (again). I waited for the oven, and I paid for it while waiting. The oven was taken to my car. The packaging looked damaged - but I was fed up and thought that stock would be checked before giving to customers - my wife actually tried to point out to me and and told the staff that the packaging looked severely damaged - and to my detriment, I carried on. incidentally the packing was just plastic film around the usual white formed foam on the edges.When I got home I took a peek as I could see the formed foam was broken and the rear of the oven had been crushed!Absolutely livid.I phoned Customer services and asked for the local store number - which they don't have but transferred me to the store. I spoke to a Customer service assistant and after I told her my story she said I would need to bring back the damaged oven - I said NO - you pickup the oven, you caused the damage! And I had had enough of the farcical customer services and ways to avoid helping customers. Then I was offered a pickup and I wouldn't be charged (I bloody well hope not) - but I would have to stay in all day 7am - 7pm. I stated unacceptable, I want a pickup either am or pm the next day. Then she stated I would have to phone the delivery guys to get them to either offer am or pm. I told her, you can phone up the delivery guys yourself as they are part of the same/related business as you will know what to tell them. I asked for her telephone number, again I was told they don't have a number to contact them in the store (for crying out loud - ridiculous). Then she stated she had customers to deal with first before she could deal with me and may not be able to get back to me until later(??!!! - what???!!).Thankfully I was phoned a short while later and I got a 7-11am time slot.> Uninterested staff> outrageously bad customer service> Doesn't anyone have pride in their jobs anymore?If I hadn't put pressure on them I would of waited again for another week. Any way of lost interest writing this and more so with Currys PC World - avoid at all costs.PS I wonder if this will be the next High street brand to go under?UPDATE: I have sent the requested email.",2018-07-03
2584,5b3aac3d6d33bc0b088559c5,"This one star is for the manager, Dave, of the Stirling store who was helpful. If it wasn't for him there would be no stars at all. You are not going to believe this one. It's long but it's worth reading for a laugh!• Ordered 4 fans for guaranteed delivery next day to this store. We needed them for the following day and were told we would be e-mailed or called when they arrived. Still no word by mid afternoon so we called. • Passed from pillar to post on the phone to Customer services. Finally spoke to a human being who informed us that DPD hadn't been yet but that we would be e-mailed as soon as it arrived.We live about 20 minutes away from the shop so we headed over there around 4pm so that we would be nearby when they arrived. Still no word by 5pm so we went into the shop. • 3 fans had arrived an hour before. Because the e-mail is automated we would not have been informed because the full order isn't there. Nobody had a thought to call us and tell us 3 of the fans were there so that we could then decide whether or not to take them.• That was poor form so we decided to cancel the order and buy 4 fans at a nearby Wickes.• We were refunded immediately for the 3 fans that had been arrived but were told that we would have to call and cancel the 4th fan ourselves. Couldn't be refunded by the store because it hadn't even arrived. The assistant informed us that DPD confirmed it was still at a depot.• I wasn't happy about going through the whole customer services telephone palaver but had no choice. • While waiting to speak to someone I was told by another assistant that we would be able to cancel the 4th fan but wouldn't receive a refund until they had located it. They would have to initiate an ""investigation"". I actually didn't believe that would happen. Surely the guy was wrong. Currys don't need to know where the fan is. They just need to know their customer doesn't have it because they failed to deliver it. My wife asked what would happen if they actually couldn't locate it. ""Would we then never receive a refund?"" ""Obviously that wouldn't be the case"", we were told but can't they see that is the logical extreme if we can't be refunded until it is located. Makes no sense at all!!!• Finally, after about 25 mins waiting on the phone the assistant got through to customer services. Not only would we not get a refund, we couldn't even cancel the 4th fan until it was actually delivered. A couple of days later!• I asked to speak to the customer services advisor and was handed the phone by the shop assistant. Incredibly, the ""customer services"" couldn't talk to me because ""this was only a customer services line for staff"". I was told to pass the phone back to the staff member. I asked if I could ask the assistant a question to pass on to the customer services advisor. He wouldn't even answer THAT question. Just kept telling me to pass the phone back.• So basically Currys and DPD failed to uphold their part of the sale but decided they could keep our money until they found where they had left our purchase.Surely this is illegal. Certainly unethical. There will have to be an absolute bargain at Currys before we will shop there again.Worst customer services I have ever received!",2018-07-02

Dear Mr. James,I write to you in despair and as a last resort prior to posting my experience on review sites. I ordered for my 92 year old father an Essentials under counter fridge online and paying via a direct debit card. This was scheduled for delivery on 1/7/2018. My father accepted the delivery but when I went to install for him the wrong item had been delivered it being an Essentials undercounter FREEZER. I contacted your customer services dept and spoke to Susan who offered apologies but was unable to have the correct item delivered until 2/7/2018. On this day I received a text message from 'teamknowhow' to say delivery would be between 10.20hrs and 14.20hrs. My father waited in all day and when it had not been delivered by 14.30hrs I contacted customer services again and spoke to a male who after making enquires stated that a freezer was being delivered but the delivery personal had no phone contact number so he was unable to confirm when. I told this person that we wanted a FRIDGE and not another FREEZER. At this point the phone went dead. I again contacted and this time spoke to Darrell who again contacted the delivery depot to find that the delivery was en route. He gave me a complaint ref CC3731206 but did say it was unlikely that I would hear anything else about it. About 1540hrs the delivery person contacted to say he was about 30 minutes away. I asked him to confirm that it was an under counter fridge he was delivering to which he responded by saying no it was a 5 foot fridge freezer. I told him in that case not to bother with the delivery, once more the phone line went dead. I again contacted customer services to be told delivery would now be 3rd July. I, at this point told him to cancel the order and refund my fathers account and we would order from else where. He responded by saying he had cancelled and the monies would be refunded within 5 working days but only when the wrong item delivered had been collected. I asked why 5 working days to refund when the monies had been taken within a day from his account. Once more the phone went dead. I have never experienced such bad service when I have previously ordered from your company and the people to whom I spoke did not seem to care about the developing fiasco. I ask that you respond to this complaint in the hope that my faith in Curry's can be restored. I have attached a copy of my original order.

2597,5b3508426d33bc0b0883e7c5,"My fridge freezer broke down suddenly so I needed to buy a freezer as an emergency replacement to save my frozen food. As I couldn't wait for next day delivery, I found a chest freezer that could be collected immediately but was only in stock in one Currys PCworld store within a 70 mile radius. Having made a 60 mile trip to collect it, I got home and unpacked the freezer only to notice that there was a 3 inch split in the outer casing, with bare metal showing. I called Customer Services the next morning to ask for the freezer to be exchanged but as I hadn't noted the serial number Currys said they couldn't do anything and told me to call back when I did have the number. I called back the next day with the serial number. I then spent over 1 1/2 hours being put on hold, passed from one person to another, and having to repeat what the problem was to numerous people.Despite eventually being given an 'uplift number' so that I could arrange for a replacement to be delivered and the damaged freezer collected, Currys have now told me they are unable to do that. I have been told that as I bought the freezer in store and took it home, and as it is only in stock at one store locally, they can only replace it at the store where I bought it. Currys have also told me it is not possible to arrange for a replacement to be delivered to my local store so that I can collect it from there. Currys also can't deliver the freezer for at least 10 days if ordered online (which is why I collected it from a store in the first place).I'm now no longer willing to risk collecting a replacement in store as, if it goes wrong, I'll only be able to get it replaced if I pack it up and drive it back to the store again! I have now told Currys I will be returning the freezer for a full refund. To do that, Currys have told me that I still have to take the freezer back into a store.Currys have sold me goods that are not of satisfactory quality or fit for purpose under the Consumer Rights Act 2015. They have then made it as difficult as possible for me to replace the item. Currys have demonstrated an appalling level of customer service. Refusing to deliver a replacement and collect the damaged goods unless it has been bought online and/or expecting customers to take damaged stock back to the store where they bought it to get a replacement rather than arranging for a replacement to be delivered to the nearest store to your home is not the way to ensure that customers continue to shop with you. Given how much the high street stores are struggling, Currys should be making it as easy and as pleasant as possible for customers to deal with them, not driving customers away.If you are thinking of buying something from Currys and it's not something that you need on the same day, I'd advise looking around to see if you can get the same item from another retailer. There are other online and high street retailers that offer next day delivery and charge the same as Currys. The level of customer service they offer is also far higher than that of Currys.",2018-06-28

2603,5b32aff16d33bc0b088332b3,"I've had many terrible experiences with Businesses, but Currys has got to be the only Company I could write a Best-Selling Novel on. Please do put up your feet as I indulge you all about my abysmal encounters with Currys which led to me believing that my life wasn't worth living and even making an attempt on my life. (Yes, you read that last bit correctly)I have a Registered Disability (Autism) and am also known to my local Mental Health Team for having severe problems with Depression, Anxiety and OCD. The year was 2015 and I was in need of a new Washing Machine and so I popped down to the Currys Store in my Home Town within Dorset.Due to my conditions, I attended the Store with my mum each time. During our first visit, I had my eyes set on a Samsung Washing Machine which had been reduced in price, although the Employee (Female Employee) was successful in persuading me to go for an LG Washing Machine instead. We made her aware of my conditions but I don't feel that the Employee demonstrated any ounce of consideration for me or my conditions and I even believe that she took advantage of me and used my conditions against me.The LG Washing Machine got delivered and installed on the agreed day, but unfortunately it became immediately obvious that something was not right. When I put a wash-cycle on, the Machine violently shook and vibrated and caused the same effect to everything within my kitchen. Further to that, my laundry came out completely unclean and this caused sores/itches/rashes to my skin and made the atmosphere within my flat far dirtier.Because of these problems, my mum and I had to make a 2nd visit to my Currys Store with the intent of resolving the problem. We were seen to by a different Employee (Male Employee) and it was concluded that the Washing Machine might not have been installed correctly by the people who installed/delivered it. (A service that I paid £30 for, on top of the £500 that the Machine itself set me back by.)It was arranged for another set of people to come out and examine the Machine; this meant having another day of being stuck indoors while waiting for the people to arrive. It turned out that the Machine had been installed incorrectly, hence the issues I was having. The installation was put right that time, although I still experienced the same problems afterwards; the shaking, vibration and the fact that my laundry wasn't being cleaned.So this meant a 3rd visit to the Store where we got seen to by the same Male Employee. This time the conclusion was that the Washing Machine itself might have been faulty and a representative from LG would have to examine the Machine. This visit to the Store was also the most insulting one as my mum and I both overheard numerous Employees making fun of the fact that I'm Autistic and that I needed to have my mum with me for support.It was arranged for LG to come out on a fixed day, which meant that I was to have a third day of being stuck indoors. I had to make alterations to my schedule so that I was able to be at home for the LG Employee, and boy did that backfire. It was a few days before the arranged day that the person from LG made contact and informed me that he couldn't attend my property like planned. The reason for this was down to Currys making a scheduling error. This left me in a position where I had to re-arrange for a different date to see to LG.The Employee confirmed that the Washing Machine was faulty and that meant a 4th visit to our Store, where we were seen to by the same Male Employee. On our most previous visit (the 3rd visit) the Employee told us that we'd be able to get a hassle-free refund if the Machine was faulty. This was not the case though as our 4th visit to the Store resulted in the Employee telling us that we needed a code that was on the Machine. Yes; we had to go back to my Flat just to get a code and then return to the Store with the code so that I could then be refunded. I failed to keep my temper under control and things got heated between the Employee and myself but I don't feel that he demonstrated any kind of understanding.I did manage to calm down enough to make a separate purchase for a different Washing Machine; a Samsung one but not the I originally wanted. The one that I originally wanted had gone back to its full price, so no joy there. I paid for the Samsung that I did eventually go with and a day was given for it to be delivered; welcome to my 5th day of being stuck indoors. Unfortunately I was presented with another disappointment; Curry's Delivery People completely missed the time that they were meant to have arrived by. My mum and I both had other priorities which meant that we couldn't be at home any longer than planned and we had to cancel the purchase altogether.I was still faced with one more visit to the Store and one other occasion of being stuck indoors. The return to the Store was so I could be refunded and the day of being stuck indoors was down to Currys needing to collect the LG Washing Machine that I originally purchased from them. In the meantime, the anxiety of all of this put me into a position where I needed intervention from my local Mental Health Team; I had to attend appointments and receive home visits.Due to yet another scheduling error made by Currys, they arrived to collect the Washing Machine at a time which was different to that agreed; they turned up when I had the Mental Health Team at my flat, hugely inconvenient. The problems didn't stop there; when removing the Washing Machine, the Staff from Currys caused damage to my kitchen. They crushed one of my £8 Fairy Detergent bottles, leaving my floor covered in the stuff. Rather than tell me about it, they just closed the door behind them and left me to spot it by myself.It was after this that I lost control of my overwhelming anxiety, overdosed on all of my medication and cut my hand open by punching through my bedroom door. I then phoned the Mental Health Team, crying hysterically from stress/panic and they had to put 999 on me for my own safety. This whole encounter with Currys went on for a total of three weeks; three weeks with no means of cleaning laundry, three weeks of anxiety so extreme it was more than I was able to cope with and left me believing that life wasn't worth living.I did write to Currys to inform them of my horrific experiences and all that they gave me in response was a highly generic letter of apology with a £50 Voucher. I responded to them, making it clear that their reply was absolutely pathetic and not a fraction of what I deserved. In the letter, I returned the Voucher to them and made it clear that I'd never step foot inside any of their Stores again. I never heard from them again; they never replied to me to try and work something out or even to apologise for seeing me go. I suppose anything above £50 is more than they're willing to depart with.I am fed up with the amount of corruption there is in this world and I honestly believe that justice is nothing more than a myth. This experience with Currys was three years ago and still it is very fresh in my mind and often haunts me on a daily basis. I will be doing everything in my power to expose people and organisations for who they are and Currys are at the very top of my priority list.",2018-08-11
2604,5b326eb76d33bc0b08831653,"Bought a new washing machine on Saturday. Installed today. Thought they did a very quick job of it... until I discovered why. We went to check the machine had it's restraining bolts removed for travel - and upon getting it out from under the counter discovered that the top of the machine looked like it had been attacked by a lump hammer and was split. There is NO WAY that they installed it not knowing that... Why even 'kin bother eh? I'd like to have got a discounted price. Not pay full whack for a discounted machine.From past personal experience - I had said to Mrs J that I didn't think we should use Currys - but I think she thought they couldn't possibly be as bad as all the bad things she's heard are. The one good thing to say about all this is that I bet her five quid the installation wouldn't run smoothly. So at least I'm five quid up.I very much doubt we'll be using Currys ever again. But I will keep this updated. We have had to use three different phone calls to complain about this. Firstly to the company, where she was offered a repair and compensation (which she flatly turned down) - then to a different line to rearrange new delivery and finally to the depot to complain about the shysters that tried to palm us off with duff goods. It's made more dispicible by the fact I'm disabled and couldn't exactly check on what they were doing.EDIT : Following Curry's, ""Concern"" over this - we were given a redelivery slot of between 9am and 1pm on Sunday. Fair enough. Sunday is a busy day for us... Unfortunately I'm good mates with the local Reverend - so he expects me to pop in to Church... but we could dodge that... then there is lunch with another set of friends down the local, it's our day for our weekly big shop and also to pop in on my ailing mother... but a delivery by 1pm should be no problem. I can juggle a few of those around.However - the delivery, of course, did not arrive by 1pm... and we are now told it'll be anywhere between now and 6pm. So that's lunch off the menu now... and the weekly shop. Nice work Curry's. You're making a bad situation worse... My wife is actually pretty cross and whereas before - I think we'd have been OK if you'd promised to tell your installers, ""To make sure you don't try to palm the customers off with reject stuff."" - she's definately after some kind of return beyond this. And she wants you to cover her five quid cash bet she lost to me. As her bookie - I think you should cover my loss of earnings as well as she didn't want to go double or quits on the 1pm delivery slot. Or indeed triple of quits on it arriving today at all.EDIT : Of course it didn't turn up by 6pm either. Wife is apoplectic with rage. She was told at 1pm when it didn't turn up that it was on the van for an afternoon delivery... Now Curry's are saying it wasn't on the van at all. So basically - we waited in all morning for a delivery that didn't come. Despite being reassured it was due for this afternoon - when they could at least have told us it wasn't going to turn up at all - it has been a thoroughly wasted day. Unbelievable. There is something VERY wrong in your distribution network. I think your Directors really should be aware. Someone is fudging something badly. Or quite well depending upon how you look at it...EDIT : After finally getting through to a depot manager yesterday evening - my wife was assured that the washing machine would be delivered again today between 9am and 1pm. Having heard this right load of donkey's before - she actually called their delivery number... and it turns out that the machine isn't actually scheduled for delivery today... How can you get this so wrong? Well. I know it's because you are Currys.PLEASE LET THIS ONGOING SAGA STEER YOU AWAY FROM DEALING WITH THIS COMPANY UNLESS YOU LIKE LONG TERM HASSLE.EDIT : Monday - six days after the initial installation of a broken but new washing machine. Curry's had told us to expect delivery between 9am and 1pm today. Wise to the fact that they would need a comprehensive map to tell their nethers from their elbow - we called the depot. It's not on the truck for delivery. My wife started crying. A lot.Note to Currys. Washing machines are more important than you may know.They have now promised to install it on Thursday. Till then good people. And do not go gentle unto the Currys PC World Superstore...EDIT - Thursday. At least Currys are progressing. They called us up at 7.50 this morning to say that the washing machine hadn't arrived overnight at their Basingstoke depot - so they couldn't deliver it today. I asked to be put through to the South African chaps manager... but he put me through to Currys complaints line. Which didn't open till 9 am.I have strict instruction from Mrs J to ask for a full refund. It is about time we ended this farce.Do not plough your hard won dosh into this dinosaur of a company. You will regret it. Let it join the list of extinct business species. It deserves a better end - but by God it needs putting out of the misery it inflicts upon others.EDIT : Some very nice people from customer services agreed this had been bad service and said please would we bear with them to push this delivery over the line...So morbid curiousity more than anything else let me. They said they'd deliver it between 9 and 1pm on Sunday... That was two hours and forty minutes ago.They've now said it'll be with us between 3 and 7pm. Apparently it is definately on the lorry today...I'm more interested in finally saying IF we got this machine finally or IF we go for a refund. I'm also interested in what Currys intend to do by way of a gesture here.",2018-07-08
2605,5b324bf96d33bc0b088304e7,Shocking experience with currys. I ordered a set of Sony headphones which were on sale for £85 and I expected them to arrive. They were quick to take money out of my bank but it turns out they were out of stock. I had to ring to find this out after waiting in for a delivery that never came. The fact that they can't send an email to let me know it is out of stock is shocking and I they certainly should not have took money out of my bank. I was then told a date that the headphones would be back in stock so I waited again for a dispatch notification. No communication again so I rang them and was told they are still not in stock. I got a refund in the end because I was sick of the poor customer service and lies. I will never be ordering from Currys again and want to warn others about buying gifts for people on here that you might not get!,2018-06-26

This has been a disgraceful neglect of the customer.Purchased a new Kenwood fridge freezer in Jan 2018. broke down and rang on 11th June, engineer over phone said parts were a guess when they wold be available, so initially spoke to a helpful lady called Nadia. She put in a request for right of as it didn't look promising and engineer said loads of these fridges going wrong. Long story short, Engineer visited on Friday 15th waited to Friday 22nd as per currys policy (their own anything happens policy) so 7 days elapsed. when I rang up I was told a request would be put in for right off and I would be notified within 72 hours. Rang back today Monday 25th and told they are only just working on 18th June right offs so may be some time. Not my problem I told them and could I speak to a manager, at 2.13pm today the 25th of June was told there wasn't one available but one would ring back by 8pm tonight. Guess what, they didn't ring back, so here I am writing this. I have spoke to Nadia,Samuel,Jonathon,Terry,Ben,Tom,Dee,Matthew, Sophie and finally Umar today. I have been told it takes from 1hr to 24 hours for emails internally to be sent and that it take from 2 to 6 days for other requests to be made for right offs. With the exception of Nadia the rest have been just passing me from pillar to post even after I explained on numerous occasions that this fridge freezer was essential as I have a severely disabled son who has meals that are prepared weekly in advance and numerous meds that are needed to be chilled, I was also more than happy to provide proof of this due to fact I was asking if they could lend me a fridge as initially the engineer said it could be weeks for parts to arrive. I have now reached the end of my tether and as far I am concerned I have a piece of scrap metal in my kitchen which I will be depositing with my son outside the new Haverfordwest store in Pembrokeshire and send some photos to the local paper explaining how currys have lied to me about their seven day policy etc and how we have struggled with cool boxes with family and friends topping us up with ice packs. This doesn;t please me writing this and as a local holiday park owner who understands the need for good customer service all I can really say is this experience has been shockingly bad. I will provide the local store manager with the opportunity to intervene before I deposit the said fridge freezer outside his or her store but I suspect I know the response I will get. I hope this helps to inform some people of the lack of worth in some areas of these policies. I have also all dates and times recorded as thankfully are most of the calls to currys.",2018-06-25
2608,5b313ceb6d33bc0b0882b77f,"On Saturday I obtained an on line IPad 2 Exchange valuation and visited the Kingston store to in order to use it against the purchase of a new I pad 2018model.Naturally my iPad needed to be examined before the exchange voucher could be issued.The assistant at the store spent 15/minutes trying to find a fault with the IPad and advised, seemingly reluctantly, that it appeared to be OK.Another technical assistant was called who also spent considerable time looking at it and then advised me that the screen was lifting and that they would not exchange it.When I asked them to show me where it was lifting they could not do so and gave some vague storey about light being reflected on the edge.In all, I was made to feel unwelcome and as if they did not want to honour the online quotation from the very start. There was no customer empathy and I was made to feel a nuisance.I left the store angry and humiliated and immediately went to the Apple store in Kingston in to order to obtain their valuation against exchange, asking them specifically to check the screen as I was now very concerned.Apple could not have been more helpful and gave the IPad a full examination. No fault could be found. An offer was made and the trade in against a new IPad was successfully completed.I will never attempt to shop at Currys again and strongly recommend any prospective buyer to look at the other reviews, as well as this one, and take their business to a store that appreciates their custom.",2018-06-25

2612,5b30ca716d33bc0c94ad60e0,"I went is to buy a new TV this weekend. The telly is fine, however the salespersons tactics to sell me the warranty was unacceptable. He told me it was for just the first month and he was going to give it to me for free as I’d bought a big telly. He said it would cover me just for the first month so that any issues I may have when I got it home would be dealt with quickly. I didn’t really think I’d have any issues, but as it was free I shrugged and said 'fine'. When I went to collect the telly, he came over and said I just needed to sign the ‘receipt’- it wasn’t a receipt at all. It was a direct debit instruction to take £5.99 every month for the warranty. This was completely mis-sold to me. I have 25 years sales experience and have never seen such blatant mis-direction.

It's really hot weather, and I am unable to store any chilled food like milk, everything is going off really quickly, and it's cost me a fortune in wasted food.

2618,5b2f6b486d33bc0b088234f9,In store price and prices in online are completely different.. I went to my local currys and found a Asus transformer which priced on £179.99 and when I asked the sales staff he told me I need to pay all together £219.99 because the initial price is just for the laptop but in addition I need to buy a windows recovery disk which was not mentioned anywhere on the price label. They cannot sale the laptop without this recovery disk. I told the agent I don't need this recovery disk I can create it myself. I can buy this laptop at the tagged price £179.99 in online and no mention of recovery disk. but why it's in store?? He could not give any satisfactory answer just said it's our in store policy. Finally I put down the laptop to bargaining with agent and ended up paying £199.99. Bare in mind this so called recovery disk is made by curry's team knowhow service. It's not even made from laptop's manufacturer. It's just a windows recovery usb disk. You can easily create if you follow some simple instructions from Microsoft website and you don't need to pay this for in currys. Currys try to make money for the sake of this recovery disk.This was my last purchase from currys and never again.,2018-06-24

Obviously hit by a fork lift truck.Called in to the call centre and they refused to let me speak to the store or a manager.Forced me into having to return the item myself; even though I said I would keep the item for a c£40 discount (We were only buying the fridge to be outside under a canopy for beers & ice creams). Tried to convince me that my consumer rights were diminished as I had picked the item up instead of allowing them to deliver. No wonder these guys are struggling financially.

During the entire time I was there the Sony rep approached me 3 times fully aware that I had decided on a TV and was ready to purchase and had tried to get someone to assist me on several attempts.

2622,5b2e488c6d33bc0b088204fa,Seems most of the reviews echo the same experiences - only wish I’d read them before buying a fridge freezer and installation. Online service until delivery where two delivery men pulled up at the side of the building without getting out of the van or even looking at the staircase said they had performed a ‘risk assessment’ and couldn’t bring it to the flat. We could either accept it on the roadside or send it back. To add insult to injury the delivery drivers were laughing through what was a very stressful encounter. This was not mentioned at any point before this nor was it asked during the purchase whether there would be any stairs involved. Same day I have found a company who said they could bring the same fridge up the stairs no problem. However we need to be without a fridge for a week while we wait for this. Awful experience and would never shop here again. Would advise others not to either. Not worth any saving on cost.,2018-06-23

After waiting in all afternoon I call the help line to to find out where my order is, after being left on hold for half an hour I finally am informed that it now will now be delivered on Saturday, without being informed of it. After waiting in Saturday morning for my delivery it arrives and I am then informed they cannot install the washing machine because the pipes don’t fit correctly in my kitchen. I am told I have to go out and find the correct pipes and then call back to arrange another visit, with no idea on what pipes are needed. Surely it is not the first time that pipes are too short, when paying £40 for installation I would expect the engineers to have spare bits like pipes with them so this situation doesn’t occur. After the engineers leave I call up the help line again to attempt to rearrange the installation to be told to call back tomorrow as they cannot confirm with the engineers that it wasn’t already done. I will be calling up again to lodge a formal complaint about the shocking service which I have recieved.

2625,5b2d80f56d33bc0bc4fb7453,"Worthing. Lyons farm store has the most arrogant, disinterested and brash, manager I have ever encountered. My experience started off fine in which on a Monday I ordered a television to be collected in store the following Friday. 6pm Friday I arrived to collect my purchase. Unfortunately there had been some sort of glitch which took a long time to sort out, but the crux of it was that my tv wasn't there, and it took around an hour to confirm this, for around half of this time the manager was off and on dealing with an increasingly angry man having some issue or other, intermittently slumping back into his mobile phone. Josh the sales assistant was great and was trying to sort out the issue they had by arranging a new delivery slot for me using the web site to my home but informed me that I would have to pay £29.99 and come in store in the next 2 days to recieve a refund for the delivery and that I had to take the managers word for it that the refund would be honoured.We chose an afternoon delivery time and I was informed it would be £49.99 for said slot but as before a refund would be given, I agreed and paid, after this there appeared to be some other problem, Josh called 'Daz' over and told him the day was no longer showing, the manager 'Daz' never acknowledged me at all but just clicked the mouse twice and walked away. Before he got back to his corner (and mobile phone) Josh called to him 'that's actually no help, there were slots a minure ago', Daz came back, looked at the screen and said 'It's Friday, tomorrow is getting booked' and returned to his phone in the corner. Tuesday was the next avalable delivery day but I am on holiday from Monday so was not able to arrange another delivery time. I then offered to buy a different tv that they may have in stock and Josh went and checked to see if there was anything that fitted but it was not the case. By now I had been 1 and a half hours in the store, during this time the manager had dealt with angry man for a short time, and served a man with a large tv under his arm whom he called 'mate' in around 30 seconds. A number of other customers came in during this time and Daz the manager's stock reply to his female colleague was 'tell Sam' before resorting to his mobile.I left with a gift card supplied by Josh to use at a later date, only to consider my experience in the car park and decided to return to question the manager as to why he did not step in to assist his staff member and customer where things cleary were not panning out. His reply was that Josh is perfectly capable and was sorry if I wasn't happy. I pointed out his not even engaging with me as he clicked the mouse prior to walking away. He said he had been busy with another client, (on his mobile maybe)? I said customer service level is very poor on your behalf and he repeated 'Josh is perfectly capable, I'm sorry if you don't agree'. He didn't even understand that Josh was not the problem!I came home and ordered same tv for Sunday morning delivery for £19.99So effectively I spent 1.5 hours in store, will get my tv 2 days late, have to arrange 4 hours of my day off to be here to recieve delivery, it cost me £20 more and have 30 quid on a gift card for a store that I have lost alot of respect for.I don't care that there was a problem. Josh aided by Jenny did their best to sort it out, but Daz the manager for me was just a poor ambassador for Currys and ruined my day.UPDATE....Marcus, Please tell me why on earth I should waste any more of my time assisting Currys? Read my review and feed it back, or was my experience not likely to stand out enough to be remembered by the staff?",2018-06-24

2627,5b2d1e776d33bc0c94aca2ac,"Today I had the misfortune to go shopping for a vacuum cleaner at the Botley Road retail park branch of Currys PC World. The service I received was the worst customer service I have ever experience in my life. It was like a trip back in time to the worst days of Dixons in the 80s!We were initially accosted by a Dyson rep, but as soon as she realised we werent interested in Dyson - left in a hurry. We then spoke to a large lady by the name of Sandra, and asked if she would help us with the cleaners. She summoned a man called Alex.We asked Alex is he would show us how the Shark cordless cleaners worked. Even though it was only 9.30 am, he told us that the batteries were flat as no one had the time to recharge them, so we couldn't see one working. we then asked to see a corded Duo Clean. He took one off the stand and after much wheezing and puffing (he was so fat he couldn't actually bend down to plug it in) he said that he had no idea how it worked as ""We don't get any training on them!"" He then suggested that we go to Argos where they might be able to demonstrate one for us. And that was it, believe it or not. It is clear that he didn't want to sell us anything and that we were just a nuisance.When I approached Sandra who was by now propping up some boxes near the entrance, to ask if I could speak to the manager, instead of taking me to meet him, she pointed out a man standing about 30 mtrs away, at a computer. This man (standing on his own) bellowed across the shop that he was ""With a customer"" and then ignored us completely.So we went to Argos, where the staff were so helpful, that was where we bought our new vacuum cleaner.Currys, here's a hint. If you want to sell stuff.....1. Do not employ neanderthal staff.2. Train your staff in the products you sell.3. Instil in your staff some pride in customer service.I will never shop at Currys again.Mike Ellis",2018-06-22

I asked the police to be called as I was in fear of my safety. He left without giving me the laptop and flicked me the bird before going (caught on picture). I would not recommend anyone buy online from Currys PCWorld You do not expect the delivery courier to be abusive and in fear of causing you harm. I wonder how seriously Currys its its customers health & safety and well-being before cheap contracts Lets see if they do.

So I took it back to local store as it clearly says on the website that you can, but you will only get a replacement or a evoucher, fine, I asked for the voucher. Then they say it has to be returned to somewhere, won't take long. I have no other choice so I go along with this. Get home and I find an email saying that in the fullness of time they will review my return? I returned it in perfect unused, but box opened condition 3 days after receiving it, so well within distance selling regulations. Now, 8 days later I'm told that they are still awaiting it at wherever they sent it to. But don't worry, it will probably arrive soon, then they will be able to review my return, what?

2634,5b2cc1616d33bc0b08819af6,"Giving 1 star for a review always comes across as harsh but there is nothing positive from my experience with Curry's.We wanted to purchase a new Integrated Dishwasher and so visited their website. This in itself was a painful experience; slow, clunky and the filtering system didn't work correctly (removing items from the search results when they should clearly appear). I managed to fudge my way through and purchase my item and also paid £44 for delivery and Installation.The item was delivered on the correct day but the delivery guy didn't install the dishwasher as apparently one of our pipes had an older valve. Why didn't the delivery guy have the correct parts with him? Surely he would have installed this product 100 times and know what to expect! He left without installing the product. It was then left with us to change the valve and then call them back. On the next visit the engineer came and could not install the dishwasher as he was not qualified to install Integrated Dishwashers, what a joke! He left without doing anything and said he'll arrange for someone else to come the next day (Saturday). We waited for most of the day for the engineer to arrive but no one came. We then called up customer support at 5pm and were told that the appointment had in fact been scheduled for Monday. This was becoming very frustrating as we wasted a whole day waiting for them.The engineer finally arrived on the Monday and installed the dishwasher only to not fit the door properly. The door came apart and now doesn't close correctly in place. We've also noticed that it hasn't been screwed in place on the sides and we can see gaps. A very botched job indeed!We also asked them if they could take our old Dishwasher away but they charge an extra £20 just for that. Having already spent £44 on installation you would think they could at least take your old one away!We called up to arrange for another engineer visit but no one came, not even a phone call to let us know that he wasn't going to make it.We've had to call up again and are currently waiting for an engineer to arrive and correct the mistakes on the last visit so that we can finally start using our dishwasher.Overall its been a terrible service from Currys. We've had bad service from the delivery engineers and have had to do all the chasing to find out what's going on including spending a total of an hour on hold on the numerous times we've had to call to find out whats going on.For these reasons I unfortunately cannot recommend using Currys and would advise to shop elsewhere.",2018-06-22

Despite it being like new and with all the original packaging I was given no other option no but to let them send it off to HP. I was given no return timetable so had to purchase another similar printer.Today I picked up my replacement printer from the Reading store and experienced disgraceful lack of customer service including that of a member of management who did not even acknowledge me and spoke over my head as if I was not there and just turned his back on me and walked off. Having had to purchase replacement HP printer I now have two and have finally learnt my lesson and myself or my family won’t spend a penny with them again.They are alll over you when your browsing but They don’t care once they have your money and do everything in their power to make sure they don’t give iyou any back.Even in my case when it was proved the product was faulty.",2018-06-22

2642,5b2a6c966d33bc06a4eba4fb,"Since we were moving to a new house, it was a perfect opportunity to upgrade the fridge/freezer. Was able to find a decent size appliancefrom Curry’s PC using online purchase via order number CUR1853309420 and delivery number 7423457467 on 9th June. Promptly, I got and email and SMS confirming the delivery is scheduled for 11th June between 7:30 and 11:30. I was happy to have found a free delivery slotin 2 days of purchasing the product. Then the waiting started……..On 11th June I was at the new house early in the morning to receive the product. Till 9:00 AM I stayed and then left. Decorators were atour new house to carry out the paint etc and they stayed till 6:00PM. Periodically I was checking the Team know how tracker for the deliverystatus. The tracker changed the status to delivered at 10:00 PM (approx.). Immediately I called up our decorators to find out if the order wasdelivered during the day or not. I got a negative response from them. Then waiting continued…….Next day I called up the Team know how to book a complaint (complaint number is CC0003717193). Customer support asked me to waitfor a week to resolve the issue. We couldn’t wait for too long as we are moving house and so I kept on calling customer supportevery couple of days. On 18th (exactly I week after complaint was booked) we received an investigation report and it reads,“We conducted an internal enquiry and as per our records the delivery was completed on 11th June and we consider the case to be closed.Should you wish to appeal, you have 14 days from the date of receiving this letter”What a crap, we paid the money, didn’t get the order, moving to a new house without a fridge…and on top of that we have to clear our reputation because Curry’s is accusing us of fraud…..Anyways appeal was filed on 18th June and awaiting a response from Team know how. We couldn’t stay in the new housewithout a fridge so ended up buying a new fridge from John Lewis. I am happy with the new purchase.In the meantime we have filed a consumer forum case and planning to file a police complaint on Saturday. It is not a huge sum but still a good amount. Henceforth I will stay away from Curry’s and hope we can get a refund and restore our reputation.For now waiting continues…….Thanx & regards,Nabs---------------Update-----------------After one month of waiting and multiple appeals, curry's are sticking to the point that shipment was delivered to me. However Curry's have admitted in writing that no signed copy of the delivery note is available, so not sure on what basis Curry's have reached that conclusion.

2649,5b27c86f6d33bc02b02d8413,"A few disappointments and annoyances recently with this company, I cannot recommend them.Nearly a year ago I bought my daughter a laptop for schoolwork. Knowing very little about computers I put myself entirely at the mercy of an apparently very knowledgeable and friendly salesman. He advised a Lenovo Ideapad. It was after some months and a lot of complaining from my daughter that I started to take her seriously and look into the problems she was experiencing. It appeared to have almost no hard drive space available and I realised after a little research that Windows 10 was occupying over 22Gb of the supposedly 32Gb which was ACTUALLY only 27Gb. With 3Gb taken up by anti-virus this machine was barely able to run itself let alone be used for creating Word and Excel documents etc for my daughter's homework as we stated to the sales 'expert'. I'll need to buy another PC now I've learned the hard way what the specs and numbers mean.Another bad experience was in April when I bought a Samsung tablet. The salesman invited me to buy the extended warranty (no thanks) 'are you sure, it's only...' (no thanks) 'well, we've got a promotion on cloud storage worth £79' (no thanks) 'look, I'll have a word with my manager' ... he came back to say he'll throw in the cloud storage for free, so I just said 'ok thanks', thinking I'll never use it. At the till he asked for my email. I don't tend to give out my email so I declined. He said he'd need it for the receipt as it's all online now. I asked if I'd be bombarded with spam, he said no, he could turn that off. I paid and HE HANDED ME A PAPER TILL RECEIPT!A few days later I started getting the spam from 'Team Know How' desperately trying to get me to sign in to the cloud storage and from a review site and some other I forget which company site. I unsubscribed from 'Team Know How' and the other sites but the spam kept coming, I eventually I had to mark it as spam to block it. Pretty disappointing experiences.",2018-06-18

I left contact details and was informed that delivery was weekly on a Thursday and I could expect to collect my laptop on 14/06/18 given 07/06/18 was too close.I waited until yesterday with no contact to inform me of progress with delivery or its arrival. After work I attended the store and was informed by the manager Andy that he could see the details of my purchase but that he could not see it having been ordered in. He advised that the assistant manager Leanne was in charge on 05/06/18 and arranged for her to give me a call today as she would have arranged the order.I did in fact receive a call from Leanne who informed me that the laptop would arrive next Thursday. When I explained I was informed it was to arrive in their weekly delivery yesterday she spoke over me advising I was incorrect and no such thing had been said. She was singularly unhelpful and advised the only thing to do was wait another week there was nothing else they could do despite already having received my money. I believe that they had failed to order in my laptop on the day of purchase and she is simply trying to cover up the mistake.To summarise; don't order or use the store unless you fancy handing over money without anything to show for it. Expect no contact with them other than that you initiate yourself, and enjoy being informed that you can simply wait until you get the product you have already paid for.",2018-06-15

I was looking to buy a TV anyway but I had my own provider with SKY already. Eventually their hard sales convinced me; I switched to Virgin with three of my original monthly rate with SKY from them. Finally I got told that in order to give me the £200 pounds cashback, they would still need to add the home phone service on my package which their system did not has the option to do it, so they advised me to sign the TV & broadband package first, come back within a week to re-add the home phone.

Everythings ok and polite when they are taking your money but when you have a problem like I did with my laptop the store agent advised it would take 2-3 weeks to repair. I asked to speak to a manager who decided in great pleasure to quote European law to me. Not what you want after being so upset with failed goods and then to be told you won't have such an invaluable item for 2-3 weeks. Not good enough, when you have an issue it's how you deal with it that makes the difference.

2677,5b1bc5ae6d33bc0fd86477da,"If, like me, you saw those big Discounts on the Currys website, then BEWARE !It always seems to take forever to complete a purchase on the Currys website. You have lots of options and offers to choose from. But £300 off this product + a 1 in 20 change of having the whole purchase price refunded is too good to miss. ...the important words are ""too good"", as in, if a price looks too good, it probably is!I was ordering a £1,500 SAMSUNG TV. I also wanted a very high quality HDMI Cable, which normally costs around £80. I'd dropped both these items into my basket and was proceeding to the checkout, when I was offered a better product: they sell the TV together with the HDMI cable under a different product code. It's £30 cheaper. Not a discount: the bundle is a different product that's £30 cheaper than buying the two items separately. And, it states very clearly on the webpage, ""Save £300 off the marked price on this product"". ...you just enter the discount code 300CBLSTC at checkout. All looks good until you try entering the 300CBLSTC discount code. It is rejected as ""invalid"". I tried getting support from the Chat people. Then I tried putting through a telephone order. In every case, Currys refused to honour their clearly stated offer to purchase the TV + HDMI product at the £300 discount. I even wrote to the CEO, Alex Baldock, politely alerting him to the issue. Their response was double-talk about the offer not being available on the bundle product, because this has a saving of £30 over buying the two items separately. So let's get this straight: I was ordering a £1,500 TV + an £80 HDMI cable, when Currys suggested I buy a different product that combined both items at a £30 lower price, and still offered ""Save £300 off the marked price on THIS product"". [My capitals on ""THIS"".] But then, when you claim the clearly advertised discount they don't want to play ball.In the conversations with Alex Baldock's office there was no hint of an apology nor even a thank you for alerting him to breaches of trading and advertising law. In fact, they suggested I couldn't read plain English. Courtesy? Not from Currys!Anyhow, GOOD NEWS is that you can use the £300 discount if you phone that well known supplier ao com, as ao com guarantee to match price. I'm now awaiting my new TV -- with a £300 discount -- from AO.**** in reply to Currys response ****It's not a ""further discount""...You're advertising a SINGLE PRODUCT that contains 2 items, as versus purchasing the two items as individual products. Stop insulting the intelligence of your customers! Your website offered this alternative single product as being better value than the two individual products I'd placed in my basket. The advertisement says that the product price is ""£1,548.99"", AND then clearly states ""Product Features"" including ""Save £300 off the marked price on this product"". That means you're advertising this bundle as a product for the discounted price of £1,548.99 less £300, which is an advertised price of £1,248.99 ! Anyhow, we'll see what the trading standards and advertising standards regulators have to say. They can read plain English as well as the rest of us.",2018-06-09

I won't go into what a shambles then occurred with teamknowhow but it ended up with me finding out a week later that the tv was not repairable and given a voucher code that I had to take to a store and collect a replacement. I explained that I purchased the TV on line as it was not convenient for me to get to a store but there was nothing they could do to help. MY WARNING to others is don't buy online from currys if you can't get to a store. I fail to understand why they cannot send me out a replacement when they delivered it to me in the first place.

Then the item you have an issue with is scanned, and the staff member will say what the computer tells them - ie, eligible for exchange/refund etc - but of course not every issue falls into a solution via this method, so getting items exchanged or fixed is frustrating.",2018-05-28

Bought a laptop at Easter, took out the insurance and everything and was pretty happy with what I had.I discovered the laptop was faulty and brought it back to be repaired, I was then told that it cannot be repaired and will need to be exchanged. I returned the laptop for and exchange for a different person to tell me this isn't possible and needs to be booked in for repair but because I have insurance it is guaranteed to back within 7 days or its automatically written off. More than 7 days passed and no laptop, so back in to Curry's to speak to a different person and then told I need to ring the number to get a code for a write off, which the staff member did for me because it was taking too long, When I rang the knowhow team to check on this I was told it takes 3-5 working days. At this time I'm already frustrated as I need my laptop and have been without it for 10 days already. The next day I received a phone call telling me the written off laptop is back and has been repaired. I go into the shop again speaking to a different person who informs me the write off only gets requested and not necessarily approved and that the guaranteed 7 day repair doesn't apply because its in its first year and it goes back to the manufacture which can take 28 days ,something no one had mentioned to me before (so what exactly is the benefit of the insurance so far?). I accept my old laptop but they have lost the cables and box I left and are unable to order parts for it so then agree to give me a new one. Then I'm told that there are none in stock and they cannot be transferred from another branch so I can reselect, but the only laptops with the same spec are more expensive and they were not willing to cover the difference. Now today I come back in to speak to the manager who refers me back to the help desk. I'm then told that there were no notes on the account about my cables and box being left there, which I asked the guy who booked it in to do for me and now being told its my fault that they are missing because Curry's don't take cables. They having to check with all colleagues to see who received the items from me and are going to back to me. It has now been 3 weeks without a laptop, told different information on every single visit I've had to the store and still no solution. I would not recommend this store to any buying a laptop.

I cannot wait to rate him to be honest and Iook forward to it. I am in the customer service environment and I have never been one to criticise as I know how hard it is to maintain the high targets set and expected but this person (counter guy) would not get to see past probation. There are some fantastic people out there desperate for work and this is very sad to see. For this guy to say the survey is about him only shows that there isn’t any teamwork amongst colleagues, just a group of individuals.

No doubt they will say that they have to send an engineer but if you read the Act you do not have to do this within the 30 day period, the word ""reject"" is the key word and if you reject the goods they must comply.The judgement of a good company is how they deal with problems and Currys fall down on this aspect so best to avoid.",2019-02-05

2807,5afa38bf6d33bc0db01305d1,"Ordered a fridge freezer and washing machine To be delivered on Saturday 12/5/18 worth over 500£.Saturday came around and I awoke at 7.30 to a missed call from the driver who stated they couldn't find the address and had continued on their route so would deliver the following day. Sunday came around and by 2pm I had heard nothing so rang the know how team. Explained the situation to the lady who assured me it would not be delivered today despite being told by the delivery driver it would be here on Sunday. I was obviously very cross as how incompetent this ""know how"" (know very little) team was. The lady could sense my frustration and offered to give me a narrow time slot for the Monday 14/5/18 from 1-5pm. I explained that I was working till 6 and my girlfriend finished at 2 so it would have to be after 2. She said she would leave a note for the driver to deliver the fridge freezer and washing machine around 5 (last delivery). 13.30 pm came around and my girlfriend received a phonecall from the delivery driver asking where she was. My girlfriend explained she was in work, and the driver asked her to leave early to receive the delivery even after she stated it shouldn't have came till after 2. The driver ťhen started being rude and dismissive with her even though it was not her fault. 8pm rolls around and another email from currys saying it will be delivered 15/5/18 from 12.30 - 16.30 when everyone will be at work. So I have paid over 500 pounds and received nothing, along with having to throw out over 100 pounds worth of now defrosted meat and other frozen and fresh items due to moving out of a tenanted property into a new house (hence why I needed the fridge freezer on the Saturday) Absoulte joke of a company, all I was offered was a soggy sorry.

Purchsing was easy and painless. Let time I purchased from the same store it was for a TV and I hit gold with the assistant who was obviously very knowledgeable, so it's the luck of the draw.

2834,5af81ed96d33bc0db0127097,"Dreadful Customer Service AVOID!Had a microwave delivered, was damaged when I unpacked item. I understand this can happen from time to time when being delivered to your home. So I called customers services, who seemed to lack any apology for this. Informed them I wanted a replacement, in turn I was told they had to receive it back at the warehouse before they would even order a replacement from the supplier. So this could take up to 2 weeks to have a new one physically at my house. So I asked to have it refunded instead and asked to raise a complaint. The agent I spoke to was rude for most of the call and when I called him out on his attitude asking to speak to a manager he went away for a few minutes. Returning after sometime saying there wasn't one available but one would call me back before 20:00. I agreed and thanked him, to have no reply and was hung up on. Not to my surprise I didn't even receive the call back. So I've now seen the item has been received back at the warehouse 5 days ago but I've had no confirmation the refund has been processed. I called customers services again to be told it'll probably be a few more days. Feeling completely fobbed off once again I accepted this. No more than a few minutes after the call I receive an email saying your return item is being reviewed. Now that clearly shows it basically hasn't even been looked at until I called. The company I used to visit and purchase from regularly has lost me and my family as a customer. Its been awful customer service from the get go and I vow never to buy from them ever again! Big companies need to learn the hard way that if they treat customers like this they will be on the news filing for insolvency.",2018-05-13

Went to the store the following day, they told me they can't return it because it was purchased online as buy now pay later. Called Currys the next working day, they told me to speak to technical team to discuss the issues even though I just wanted to return the Laptop. Called the technical team the following day, spoke to a rude and blunt man who told me I wasn't allowed to return the laptop out of choice even though I am within the return window. He put me through to someone else who arranged collection of the laptop today and said I would receive a text this morning about collection time, but have not received any notification of this so far at 2pm and am now chasing this up again myself.

2878,5af32a416d33bc09ec06870d,"Two ""fitters"" arrived today to fit my Bosch integrated dishwasher. Unfortunately, neither of them seems to have discovered soap or deodorant, as they had extremely offensive body odour. This could be forgiven if they were at all competent and sufficiently trained to undertake the task at hand. Alarm bells started to ring at the first hurdle, when the fitter told me he was unable to/unwilling to disconnect the water feed from the isolation valve due to it being Ina slightly awkward location. His position was that I would need a plumber and that it would have to be delivery only. After I pointed out a single technique using two sets of grips he managed to simply undo the nut and complete the removal. Withdrawing the machine went reasonably well, although he put his tools and metal work on my granite Work top without protection wasn't ideal. Then came the power supply, which was wired into a flex outlet and not a plug. At this point I got my own tools and test metre and unwired and connected the new one myself. In the meantime, the ""fitters"" set about installing my kitchen door to the new dishwasher which was on my driveway, as opposed to fitting the appliance and carefully aligning the unit and door once fitted, as per the instructions and standard installation practice! As a result, the door is not correctly aligned with the kitchen cabinets and cannot be aligned without removing the dishwasher or removing and refitting the door again. After several attempts they managed to get the unit as level and flush as they could - through trial and error, set the unit to rinse to proudly demonstrate their work before refitting the plinth below the row of cabinets. Once the rinse cycle had finished and they had left, I went to open the dishwasher only to find that the door only opened to about 45 degrees instead of the required 90 due to the cabinet door fouling the plinth. After opening the installation instructions myself and reading them it very clearly stated in step 8 that the plinth is required to be trimmed under the dishwasher to allow the door to pass through the due to the way the door is hinged. Therefore my dishwasher is not only badly installed, but also unusable. Upon phoning know how to complain, I was told I would have wait until Friday for someone else to attend as I Cleary did not want the same fitters to return as they clearly lack the skills and knowledge to fit as dishwasher. No apology was offered or means to make a formal complaint about the service.",2018-05-09

2880,5af310826d33bc0db0112b87,"I mistakenly thought buying from a local shop would mean if I ever got any problems whilst still under warranty I would have nice easy local shop to solve my problems. Unfortunately if your faulty item is over 30 days but still under warranty they seem absolutely dis-interested in helping. They seemed more interested in telling me I should have bought their extra cover. I just got fobbed off to contact the manufacturer. I expect that is all they have to do under European warranty law but I have found other retailers take ownership of their customers needs and after sales support far better. Makes it an easy choice where to buy from next time.Update : After dropping off the printer at the Poole store 12 days ago I have heard nothing since despite promises of resolution in 7 days.

2904,5af13ce56d33bc09d016d679,I bought a Neff Oven in Oct 17 Order No CUR1746862697 on the understanding that i would receive £40 in my TopCashback account. The oven cost £679.00 and was available at that price from both Currys and John Lewis but because i could get the extra £40 i decided to buy from Currys.I placed the order and agreed to wait until the oven came into stock this would be approx 3 weeks.When Currys contacted me with a delivery date I accepted their date and took delivery on that day.After i took delivery I contacted TopCashback to ask why the £40 had not shown in my account and they said they would investigate. After a few months they came back with a reply from Currys that I had not met all of the terms and conditions but i ordered paid and accepted delivery so i am unsure of what else they though i should do to get the payment.I feel that I have been misled by Currys into thinking i would get the payment so as to place the order with them but this never happened so next time I will stock with a company i can trust and not believe their offer.This is the last time i will buy from either Currys or Carphone Warehouse My advice is put the customer first and profit will follow but if you put profits first customers will not return.You might have saved £40 but you lost a customer for both goods and mobile phone contracts,2018-05-08

We came back from a holiday at the end of April this year and the TV wouldn’t work. I went down to my local store (Crewe) and the staff were helpful and gave me the Knowhow telephone number. I duly phoned them and they arranged to pick up the TV on Wednesday. On Tuesday afternoon I got a text telling me one of their ‘experts’ would be with me between 8am and 1pm. Sure enough at 11am the ‘expert’ arrived, took one look at the TV on the wall, and said ‘I am not qualified to take that I might drop it’. He said he would make a call. He came back in and told me a specialist technician would come out on Friday - an ‘expert expert’ I thought. Sure enough on Thursday afternoon I got a text saying the ‘expert’ would be with me between 3pm and 7pm. That expert never arrived, texted or phoned. Presumably he/she was not expert enough to find an address or work a telephone! On Saturday evening I got another text from Knowhow to tell me their ‘expert’ would be with me between 10am and 2pm on Sunday. Sure enough a truck pulled up and two ‘experts’ got out. I invited them in, they took one look at the TV and said we can’t take it. I politely expressed my frustration and one said i’ll report it to our manager. He then said ‘Could you sign my sheet so they know I have been’. The problem not really being his fault I did sign it. Following this I drove down to the store again. Very helpfully they called Knowhow which after about 25 minutes eventually answered the phone. The store assistant carefully explained the problem but the guy on the other end of the line wasn’t able to help much. I suggested I spoke to him which I did. After some discussion I was told a special tech would be out on Friday. I said that wasn’t satisfactory as that was the date I was initially promised the fixed TV would be delivered back. I asked to speak with a manager and was told the manager would only be able to tell me what I had already heard. I insisted and eventually I put on hold whilst the manager was contacted. After a short while the original chap came back on, gave me a service reference number, and said the manager would call me. Needless to say he or she hadn’t. Presumably they expect me to wait until Friday - i’m not! I should clarify that when I was setting up the initial collection I was not asked if the TV was wall mounted - I would assume that at least 50% are. The wall mount is the one supplied with the TV when I purchased it from Curry’s.",2018-05-07

After half an hour, there turned out to be a stock problem. They couldn't find one of the laptops, but could order one from elsewhere for us. But not for a week. Since we wanted the item immediately, due to coursework to finish, we said no and finally left. They did try and accommodate us and so that will always be a good mark. We decided to go to another store and here we did much better. Not only did they actually have the laptops I'd seen Currys/PC world online.

2915,5af023386d33bc0abc3445a0,"My favourable experience of Curry's PC world is based on repeated in-store shopping on the Newcastle high-street as well as an online purchase. Items I bought in the store included a wifi adapter, a Ninja food blender, amongst other things. My online purchase and delivery to the store concerned a budget monitor. Unlike in many other big shops, staff at Curry's PC World is always available and very helpful, and not overtly pressuring customers to buy as such, which makes for the best in-store experience. I appreciated being able to compare different laptops at my leisure while getting all the advice I needed from the staff, which helped to complement online reviews of products which I had read prior to my visits. I have always been happy with the items I bought in store based on staff recommendation, and was made aware of all possible warranty extensions and purchase bundles available. One laptop I was interested in was unfortunately unavailable, and I was not so keen on buying the next-best alternative, based on mixed customer reviews I had read online. I bought another laptop online from another provider in the end. But as said staff support at the Currys PC World store was just great. Maybe the range of laptops could be expanded somewhat, for example including a wider range of 15.6 inch laptops with different specs and from different brands. HP somewhat seems over-represented. The online purchase was smooth and delivered rather quickly to the store (I had chosen flexible delivery to the store). It came before the actual expected date of delivery to the store. Collecting the item from the store was effortless. Overall I highly recommend purchasing from Currys, and am very satisfied as customer.

I requested to speak to a 'manager' and was informed that was not possible as he was 'busy' however Qesa was logging my complaint. Qesa stated he could rebook my installation for a later date but could not send someone round to install product as it was not on his 'system' as it had not 'updated' after putting me on hold for 5 minutes he came back on line stating install had now 'appeared' on his computer however could not get someone to install dishwasher today. I stated that I cannot have a heavy dishwasher preventing access to the cooker as we/carers need it to prepare meals. Qesa stated he could give me £30.00 as a goodwill gesture for inconvenience however could not get it installed until a later date, he stated that he would contact another department and can arrange for a team to come round and 'move the dishwasher' to a suitable place until they could install. I explained there was no place for the dishwasher to be placed apart from blocking the 'back door' which would compromise emergency access. Qesa suggested we put dishwasher in our lounge therefore blocking access to my wife's mobility and restricting our movements as we only have a small lounge with limited space and access. Qesa stated that this was a better option than blocking the 'back door'. I stated that this was totally unacceptable and he was not taking my complaint or concerns seriously and requested again to speak to the 'manager' which he refused still stating he was 'busy 'and would tell me the same thing as he had . Qesa stated after putting me on hold again he had contacted another department and would arrange for 'someone to move 'dishwasher' to a place away from the cooker, he then offered me a install date of 'Wednesday' 9th of May which I refused as cannot have a heavy dishwasher in my kitchen blocking access to back door as it is an emergency access point. Qesa then stated I 'could arrange my own installation at further cost to myself. I stated that this was totally unacceptable therefore requested a full refund of my money and collection of the dishwasher today in order for me to order another one from another retailer, he said he would get the product collected today and would issue a full refund of monies paid within 3-5 working days.I would like Curry's/Pc World to acknowledge that their customer services and systems are not fit for purpose and if they can guarantee next day delivery and you purchase installation this should be on the delivery sheet at point of receiving the order. Customer service agents should be able put you through to a 'manager' on request and not state they are 'busy' and unable to talk to customers in order to try and resolve issues more effectively. my wife and I feel very upset and let down by their lack of compassion and understanding of peoples needs especially when dealing with vulnerable customers who have disabilities and carer needs. Customer advisors should not suggest appliances be left in spaces which are required for emergency access or in lounges/ other access points further restricting access and causing further health and safety issues. I would like a full explanation of how when you order a delivery and install it fails to recognise installation as part of delivery. Curry's are quick to take your money and state to offer a good service however their delivery and customer service team are appalling. Staff require training on dealing with vulnerable customers and undertake disability awareness training on assisting customers with special needs.Further update: I contacted customer services again at 17:15 to enquire about collection which I was assured will be collected today and was informed this should have been collected by 15:00 and received a telephone call, however no phone call or collection taken place. Further telephone call made at 17:32 spoke to Diana who put me on hold for 10 minutes then stated she had spoke to depot and they were unable to collect dishwasher today as they had 'no one' available at this time to collect as they were closed despite being assured it would be collected today and that I would have to wait until tomorrow for collection or arrange to have my own installation at further cost to myself and they could not reimburse my payment until it had been collected. I further explained that we were unable to have this plumbed in ourselves and that we had not eaten a hot meal today as dishwasher was blocking cooker resulting in not being able to be moved. I again stated we were both disabled and rely on hot meals being prepared and the dishwasher being important to clean up after by the carers. I requested again to speak to a manager and was informed yet again that this was not possible as it was 17.50 and they were getting ready to go home as they close at 18.00. Again I was informed that there was nothing the company could do today and had no choice but to wait till tomorrow Sunday 6th May for collection and refund could take several days resulting being unable to purchase another from a different supplier due to no finances to purchase it. I am totally disgusted, angry frustrated and upset, as we purchased item with belief and installed on delivery and now we are unable to access hot meals which we rely on resulting in sandwiches twice today for lunch and dinner. My Wife has dementia, registered partially sighted and other life reducing illnesses and is now unable to access the kitchen due to risk of falls. I am registered disabled with very poor mobility and dexterity and have just had an operation therefore we rely on carers to assist with all daily tasks. I need this case t be looked at seriously and a further full explanation given of what appears to be total Incompetence of a company that is happy to take my money and fail to deliver on CUSTOMER SATISFACTION to resolve and assist customers and give false promises. I will be purchasing all major household items from other suppliers.Further update to case: Sunday 6th May Spoke to Adam at customer services who stated despite being promised collection today this has not been booked therefore dishwasher still in front of cooker. Adam also stated Donia (customer services advisor) I spoke to yesterday at 17.32 had not processed my refund of installation charge £49.99, delivery charge £9.99 and recycling charge of £15.00 as promised she had done immediately.Adam stated he was trying to get dishwasher collected as soon as possible and that earliest date for collection was Tuesday 7th May but could not guarantee a time. I explained I need a morning collection as have a hospital appointment in the afternoon following my back operation last week however he stated he is unable to book a specific time and collection will take place all day resulting in me having to cancel my hospital appointment.The dishwasher is still blocking my cooker meaning another two days without proper hot cooked food we both require to maintain our health and well being.Clearly I am EXTREMELY ANGRY and upset as I/we cannot access our kitchen to allow carers to prepare hot meals.I was also advised I do not get copy of complaints raised and outcomes as it dealt with internally and customers are not notified of outcomes of complaints which is WRONG as we the customer don’t have any idea what action has been taken by incompetent staff who give false information, lie to customers and give insensitive advice to vulnerable customers. I feel that all complaints should have a response to customers and will be raising this issue with others, social media, disability groups and have taken pictures of where dishwasher is placed which I will be posting on my social media sites and am prepared to share with local press and media.I must add Adam was very professional in his demeanour and very helpful, this addendum is no reflection on the way he dealt with me today.",2018-05-06

2930,5aedb1aa6d33bc0b9814e4e4,"Me and my partner visited the store to buy a new tv. We wasn't approached and trying to find a member of staff was extremely diffucult. We finally found a lady where she asked us what we would like assistance with. I explained we had found a tv we wanted to purchase and she asked me what it was called quite abruptly. I went on to say I will show her what one it is as I hadn't got a clue. She followed me and I got to the tv and turned around and she wasn't there. I waited just under 5 minutes (she was in clear view) then I went over and asked if she was still helping us. She then said she was getting some paper, which she already had and was just stood there having a laugh with her colleagues. She then sarcastically said ""I will be there right away for you"" and yet still stood there for a few further minutes talking. This made me feel very uncomfortable as I felt she was mocking me. Once she arrived and took the stock number she then proceeded to show us wall mounts which I had explained we didn't need. After 3 times of telling her we didn't require one she then got snotty and rather rude. We then went to the counter where she took all our details ect and still kept making sly remarks over how I'd turned down certain products, again this made me feel very pressured and uncomfortable. Overall my experience was a total night mare because of this lady who I'm sure was a supervisor so it's even more disgusting.",2018-05-05

Returned about 1-2 hours later to find water all over my kitchen floor so I looked for the leak it is coming from a stop tap that is behind the washing machine I ring the delivery drivers that delivered the machine no answer so I ring knowteam helpline and the man said he was going to ring them but they don't answer to him either we chat for a little then my mobile rings and it's the delivery drivers they are coming straight back so I hang up both phones and wait.About 10-20 mins later they arrived the man that fitted the machine is angry he makes me feel very uncomfortable comes in yanks the washer out and started saying it's not his fault the other man tells him to calm down he says it's nothing to do with me then finds the leak wipes it saying something pushes it back in saying their it's sorted no damage and they left, I cleaned the water up, when my partner came home he looked at the machine and where he pushed the machine back so hard he has dented it.I took pictures and went into the shop to speak to the manager about it he refunded my delivery and said to send me pictures of it and it will be investigated, Didn't hear anything went in again he's on holiday, the next 2 times I went in he's not there So I sent pictures again and again and still I haven't heard anything back.

2941,5aec262b6d33bc09bc99b25f,"Cooker we bought on sale, which was good. Damage to grill pan on arrival, replacement sent by New World in three days which was good. Only point I would like to make is that we last bought a cooker twenty years ago when it came with a hose to connect it and now regulations are very different , and this could be made more explicit on website (unless I missed it). In hindsight I feel a bit foolish but you can’t possibly know about these things unless you deal with them all the time. So I only blame myself for not booking the installation but my point is that when I read what the installation entailed it did not include the provision of hose and registration of installation, which would have alerted me to changes in regulations over the many years since we last bought a cooker. I am only writing this to hopefully prevent anyone else doing what I did. The gas engineer who we used to install cooker has explained all the regs., so now I know, but he also said it is forever changing anyway, so what is so now may change over time. Hope my point is clear,thanking you, Mike",2018-05-04

2945,5aeb970d6d33bc0cac1fde25,"I bought a Dell Inspiron laptop from Currys PC World. Now, Dell are sneaky, as I found out: they give you a chip that supports UHD resolution, but the display doesn't. The sticker on the bench said ""Full HD - 1080"", which was correct; there aren't enough dots to display UHD images regardless of the chip. But was that going to stop the salesman from telling me it was UHD? Not for a second! The difference between this laptop and that gaming laptop over there is the display, this one has a better display, because it's UHD. I asked him several times, is this really UHD? I went away and Googled it, and came back half an hour later and asked him again, are you sure it's UHD? Sadly, this chap's English wasn't perfect, and he had a talent for not quite answering the question I'd just asked him, but when he said the words ""the sticker is wrong"" and told me how the 8th generation chip makes it UHD, and then pointed to the letters ""UHD"" on the receipt, I was as reassured as I could be.So I collect the laptop and, of course, the maximum resolution is Full HD - 1080. Exactly one quarter of the UHD resolution I was sold. The sticker had been correct.Well, all I can say is that the team in the store had clearly been trained in the ""dark arts"" of complaint handling. What do I mean? I mean the way that, whenever it seemed like I was getting somewhere talking to one person, I was hurriedly pointed in the direction of another. I mean the way they designated one guy as the ""bad cop"" whose job was to hover behind whoever I was talking to and laugh at my hopelessness - fancy not knowing the difference between ""display resolution"" and ""output resolution""! Fancy expecting a laptop to have UHD resolution for that price! I mean the way that same guy waited until the cashier was halfway through refunding my money but letting me keep Office 16 as compensation, before chiming in with ""you do realise the system won't let us do that?"" I mean the way they handed me the number of their ""head office"" (their call centre, in fact) to get me to talk to someone whom they knew could do nothing to help because I bought the laptop in store and not online. (He was perfectly pleasant about it all. Thank you, call centre guy!) I mean the way they carefully wrote down the numbers 3840 and 2160 and then asked me ""so you want four thousand lines down the screen?"" as though UHD was some strange concept that I'd just invented. I mean the way the manager said ""what we can do you is... *dramatic pause* a full refund,"" as if this was an act of personal generosity and not a simple exercise of my consumer rights having been sold one thing and given another.But who's this I see - it's the same member of staff who sold me the laptop! Surely he must be able to clear up the fact that he sold me a UHD laptop and therefore, at the very least, apologise for not delivering me a UHD laptop?""That's right, it's 1080 resolution.""But you told me the sticker was wrong, how is the sticker wrong?""There's nothing wrong with the sticker sir.""You told me two weeks ago the sticker was wrong, what did you mean by that?""We get a lot of customers in here sir.""I'm telling you that that's what you said. THE STICKER IS WRONG. Those were your words.""But the sticker is correct.""Yes. I know it's correct. So why did you tell me two weeks ago it was wrong?""Is that the same sticker that was on there before? I don't know.""Yes, it's the same sticker. You told me it was wrong. You lied to me so that I would buy this laptop from you.""Listen, I'm not saying that you're a liar or I'm a liar or anyone's a liar...""Look! Here on the receipt! It's got the letters UHD on it in black and white!""That's just a product code sir, I'll be honest with you, I don't look at that, it's just something that's on the system, some of them say DA, some of them say DS, it doesn't mean Ultra High Definition necessarily.""I accepted the manager's offer of £50 to take my new laptop and go away and not come back, because it's useless arguing any further with staff who'll tell you to your face that black is white. Still, I made no promise that I would give them a good review. If you want a new laptop, just do the research online and then head to Amazon. The added ""human touch"" of the Currys PC World staff will make your experience worse, not better.",2018-05-03

I wanted one with a good level of warranty cover and was happy with one of the brands I found on Currys and I believe they are the only company that stock this particular brand. Their website also provides a number of filter options that enabled me to find an appropriate product (I also confirmed this information directly on the manufacturer's own website). The price was reasonable and they were offering at the time a small discount online. I got free delivery in two days time which was also great (ordered on 26th and received on 28th). The delivery drivers also did a good job and reminded me the appropriate time to wait before installing the product (this information is also giving in the product manual).
